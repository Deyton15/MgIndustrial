Hunger and poverty have worsened with the dawn of COVID-19 pandemic and on-going Russia–Ukraine war. The study seeks to assess food security and associated socio-economic factors among farming households in Lesotho. Household food security has been assessed using Household Food Access Scale (HFIAS) and Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS). Questionnaires were employed to collect data from 236 farming households. Results: The HFIAS results show that 40% of the farming households were food secure, 18% were mildly food insecure, 32% were moderately food insecure and 10% were severely food secure and severe food insecurity mostly experienced in the highlands. HDDS results indicated that the farming households had consumed 8 to 12 food groups 7 days prior to data collection, the mean HDDS is 9.68. Households that are involved in commercial farming had more (9.98) diverse diets than those in subsistence farming (8.67). Households in the highlands have the lowest diet diversity (9.0) among the four agro-ecological zones. A logistic regression analysis indicated that the socio-economic factors associated with food security were household income, household size, marital status and education status of the respondent. Conclusions: The findings depict that over half (60%) of the farming households experience varied degrees of food insecurity. Contrary to this, the farming households had consumed highly varied diets in the past 7 days. The socio-economic factors that influence the attainment of food security household food security were household size, household income, education and marital status. The findings suggest that agricultural development interventions must be more sensitive to household food security and nutrition, which includes training farmers on nutrition and food security issues. Furthermore, socio-economic factors must be considered in the development of interventions, since they influence the food security of the farming households. © 2024, The Author(s).","Farming households; Household dietary diversity; Household food insecurity access scale; Household food security","","N.

Intensive land use, water scarcity, land disturbance, and global climate change have reduced the quality of soils worldwide. This degradation directly threatens most of the land in the Middle East and North Africa, while the remaining areas are at high risk of further desertification. Rehabilitation and control of these damaged environments are essential to avoid negative effects on human well-being (e.g., poverty, food insecurity, wars, etc.). Here we review constructed soils involving the use of waste materials as a solution to soil degradation and present approaches to address erosion, organic matter oxidation, water scarcity and salinization. Our analysis showed a high potential for using constructed soil as a complimentary reclamation solution in addition to traditional ones. Constructed soils could have the ability to overcome the limitations of existing solutions to tackle land degradation while contributing to the solution of waste management problems. These soils facilitate the provision of multiple ecosystem services and have the potential to address particularly challenging land degradation problems in semi and dry climates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Arid soil; Constructed soil; Plant adaptation; Restoration; Soil formation","Africa, Northern; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Soil; Middle East; North Africa; Climate change; Ecosystems; Land use; Restoration; Waste management; organic matter; Arid soils; Constructed soil; Ecosystem services; Intensive land use; Land degradation; North african countries; Plant adaptation; Soil degradation; Soil formations; Water scarcity; adaptation; arid environment; economic activity; environmental assessment; environmental restoration; soil degradation; soil quality; climate; constructed soil; dry season; ecosystem restoration; ecosystem service; environmental erosion; environmental health; environmental reclamation; health care quality; human; land degrdation; Middle East; Middle Eastern/North African; mulch; nonhuman; North Africa; oxidation; plant growth; Review; salinization; semiarid climate; socioeconomics; soil degradation; Southern Europe; surface soil; waste; waste management; water insecurity; Africa; ecosystem; environmental protection; soil; Soils","M.

These soil microbiomes render important ecosystem services associated with soil fertility, water holding capacity, and stability to the areas they cover. Because of the importance of biocrusts in the global cycling of nutrients, there is a growing interest in describing the many microbial configurations these communities display worldwide. However, comprehensive 16S rRNA genes surveys of biocrust communities do not exist for much of the planet: for example, in the continents of South America and the northern part of Africa. The absence of a global understanding of biocrust biodiversity has lead us to assign a general importance to community members that may, in fact, be regional. Here we report for the first time the presence of biocrusts in Colombia (South America) through 16S rRNA genes surveys across an arid, a semi-arid and a dry subtropical region within the country. Our results constitute the first glance of the Bacterial/Archaeal communities associated with South American biocrust microbiomes. Communities where cyanobacteria other than Microcoleus vaginatus prevail, despite the latter being considered a key species elsewhere, illustrate differentiable results in these surveys. We also find that the coastal biocrust communities in Colombia include halo-tolerant and halophilic species, and that niche preference of some nitrogen fixing organisms deviate from previously described global trends. In addition, we identified a high proportion (ranging from 5 to 70%, in average) of cyanobacterial sequences that did not match any formally described cyanobacterial species. Our investigation of Colombian biocrusts points to highly diverse communities with climatic regions controlling taxonomic configurations. They also highlight an extensive local diversity to be discovered which is central to better design management and restoration strategies for drylands soils currently undergoing disturbances due to land use and global warming. Finally, this field study highlights the need for an improved mechanistic understanding of the response of key biocrust community members to changes in moisture and temperature.

The various types of land use, especially agriculture and forestry, account for nearly a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the world's soil is under pressure from many factors, including climate change and land use change. Increases in temperature, prolonged drought and floods put pressure on the soil. In order to contribute to a better understanding of these interactions, we conducted a review combining a narrative-focused approach, selecting examples worldwide, and a bibliometric analysis (VosViewer software). This review reports on a study that analyses how climate change and land use change may negatively influence soil biodiversity and related services. It also outlines some of the actions needed to increase the resilience of soil biodiversity in the context of a changing climate. Some key findings are: 1) Well-managed soils are critical for resilient production systems. 2) Integrated agricultural production systems have gained prominence as climate-resilient production systems. 3) Agricultural zoning may be a valuable tool in integrated systems to minimise the effects of climate change. However, it is vital to continuously monitor environmental variations so producers can be more prepared for climate change and extreme events. Finally, adequate water management is essential for soil functioning under climate change aggravating water scarcity. An intersectoral approach between critical sectors facilitates comprehensive water management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Food production; Global change, adaptation; Resilience; Sustainability","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Gases; Soil; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Soils; Sustainable development; Water management; Change adaptations; Ecosystem services; Food production; Global change; Global change, adaptation; Landuse change; Production system; Resilience; Soil biodiversity; Waters managements; adaptive management; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; environmental monitoring; food production; land use change; software; soil biota; sustainability; bibliometrics; biodiversity; climate change; drought; ecosystem service; flooding; food industry; global change; land use; narrative; review; software; soil; water insecurity; water management; agriculture; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; greenhouse gas; Climate change","G.J.

In the last 2 years, tuberculosis has affected an estimated 10 million individuals, and 1.4 million people have died worldwide. In Ethiopia, the weight of the problem is less known in the study area. As a result, the purpose of this study was to assess food insecurity and associated factors among adult patients with tuberculosis attending public health facilities in Grawa district, Eastern Ethiopia. Methods: A multicenter facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 01 March to 31 March 2022, among 488 randomly selected adult tuberculosis patients on treatment follow-up at public health facilities in Grawa district, Eastern Ethiopia. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire through a face-to-face interview and document review, entered into EpiData version 3.1, and analyzed using SPSS version 25. The prevalence was reported using a 95% confidence interval (CI) and summary measures. Predictors were assessed using a multivariable logistic regression analysis model and reported using an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% CI. Statistical significance was declared at a p-value of <0.05. Results: Overall, the prevalence of food insecurity among the study participants was 19.5%, with a 95% CI (15.8%, 23.2%). Factors such as being male [AOR = 0.58, 95% CI: (0.34, 0.97)], being married [AOR = 2.93, 95% CI: (1.33, 6.47)], being merchant [AOR = 0.22, 95% CI: (0.04, 0.67)], having low wealth quintiles [AOR = 2.10,95%CI:(1.04–4.23)], receiving anti-TB treatment for two or fewer months [AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: (0.26–0.91)], using khat [AOR = 2.18, 95% CI: (1.29, 3.70)], and owning livestock (AOR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.29–0.94) were significantly associated with food insecurity. Conclusions: According to this study, nearly one out of every five adults TB patients is food insecure. Factors such as being male, being married, being merchant, having low wealth quintiles, receiving anti-TB treatment for two or less months, those who chew mKhat and having a livestock were significantly associated with food insecurity. As a result, all stakeholders and concerned entities should prioritize improving the livelihood of TB patients through social security system programs, which are critical to the success of TB control and prevention efforts.

Conversely, disorganized attachment is associated with social, emotional, and behavioral problems in children, and later psychopathology. Children with a developmental delay or disability (DD) may be at greater risk of insecure or disorganized attachment than children without DD. This systematic review aims to (1) synthesize the available evidence worldwide regarding attachment and children with DD and (2) to examine the effectiveness of interventions employed to prevent or address attachment insecurity for this population. Peer reviewed articles with four-fold attachment classification data or attachment interventions for children with DD were included in the review. Seventeen databases were searched for studies published in English from January 1980 to January 2019. The systematic review protocol was registered a priori with PROSPERO (CRD42018117574). Twenty-three articles met the inclusion criteria, nine containing strange situation procedure (SSP) data and 14 relating to interventions. Meta-analysis was conducted with data from six of the SSP articles (n = 215). The remaining articles were reviewed narratively. Results indicate that children with DD are significantly less likely to develop a secure attachment and significantly more likely to develop a disorganized attachment than children without DD. Emerging research indicates promise that early intervention may be effective in improving attachment security. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.","Attachment; developmental delay; disability; intervention; meta-analysis; systematic review","","S.L.

This approach has been widely applied in both developing and developed countries worldwide, providing a cost-effective method for industrial wastewater treatment and the improvement of environmental water quality. However, due to the large organic carbon inputs, CWs is produced in varying amounts of CH4 and have the potential to become an important contributor to global climate change. Subsequently, research on the mitigation of CH4 emissions by CWs is key to achieving sustainable, low-carbon dependency wastewater treatment systems. This review evaluates the current research on CH4 emissions from CWs through bibliometric analysis, summarizing the reported mechanisms of CH4 generation, transfer and oxidation in CWs. Furthermore, the important environmental factors driving CH4 generation in CW systems are summarized, including: temperature, water table position, oxidation reduction potential, and the effects of CW characteristics such as wetland type, plant species composition, substrate type, CW-coupled microbial fuel cell, oxygen supply, available carbon source, and salinity. This review provides guidance and novel perspectives for sustainable and effective CW management, as well as for future studies on CH4 reduction in CWs.

It affects primarily children under five (CU5), women of reproductive age (WRA), and pregnant women due to their higher need for iron. The most common form of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). IDA is estimated to cause half of all anemia cases and one million deaths per year worldwide. However, there remains a lack of well-documented and biochemically assessed prevalence of IDA based on the representative population-based samples globally and regionally. In this study, we aimed to assess the National Nutrition Survey (NNS) 2018 to identify the prevalence and risk factors of IDA in Pakistani CU5 and WRA. Methods: Secondary analysis was conducted on the NNS 2018, a cross-sectional survey, which collected data on dietary practices, malnutrition, and food insecurity. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin levels < 11.0 g/dL in children and 12.0 g/dL in women. IDA was defined as low hemoglobin and low ferritin (<12 ng/mL) levels, adjusted for inflammation using AGP and CRP biomarkers in CU5 and WRA. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted using Stata statistical software (version 16). We also compared the IDA rates of NNS 2018 and 2011. Results: A total of 17,814 CU5 and 22,114 WRA were included in the analysis. Of the CU5, 28.9% had IDA, while 18.4% of WRA reported to experience IDA. Among the CU5, IDA was most prevalent among male children aged 6–23 months living in rural areas and with the presence of diarrhea and fevers in the last 2 weeks. Children whose mothers had no education, were aged 20–34 years, and employed, had a higher prevalence of IDA. Married WRA, who are employed, living in rural areas, and with no education, had a higher prevalence of IDA. In the multivariable logistic regression, children aged 6–23 months (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.08–1.33], p < 0.001) and with the presence of diarrhea in the last 2 weeks (AOR = 1.32, 95% CI [1.13–1.54], p < 0.001) or fever (AOR = 1.16, 95% CI [1.02–1.32], p = 0.02) had higher odds of IDA. At the household level, the odds of IDA among CU5 were higher in the poorest households (AOR = 1.27, 95% CI [1.08–1.50], p = 0.005), with ≥5 CU5 (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI [1.28–3.11], p = 0.002), and with no access to improved sanitation facilities (AOR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.02–1.34], p = 0.026). For WRA, the multivariable logistic regression found that the odds of IDA were higher among women with vitamin A deficiency (Severe: AOR = 1.26, 95% CI [1.05–1.52], p = 0.013; Mild: AOR = 1.36, 95% CI [1.23–1.51], p < 0.001), zinc deficiency (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI [1.28–1.57], p < 0.001), no education (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI [1.30–1.81], p < 0.001), and from severely food insecure households (AOR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.07–1.34], p = 0.001). The odds of IDA were lower among women whose body mass index was overweight (AOR = 0.77, 95% CI [0.69–0.86], p < 0.001) or obese (AOR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.62–0.81], p < 0.001). Conclusions: The child’s age, presence of diarrhea or fever, place of residence, household size, wealth status, and access to sanitation facilities were significantly associated with IDA among CU5 in Pakistan. For WRA, education, body mass index, vitamin A and zinc status, household food security status, wealth status, and access to sanitation facilities were significantly associated with IDA. Large, well-established, government-funded programmes focused on micronutrient supplementation, food fortification, the diversification of food supplies, and the treatment and prevention of infectious and parasitic diseases are needed to prevent IDA and all forms of anemia among children and women in Pakistan. © 2023 by the authors.","children under five; iron-deficiency anemia; Pakistan; risk factors; women of reproductive age","Anemia; Anemia, Iron-Deficiency; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hemoglobins; Humans; Male; Nutrition Surveys; Pakistan; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Risk Factors; biological marker; C reactive protein; ferritin; hemoglobin; retinol; vitamin D; zinc; hemoglobin; adult; Article; body mass; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diarrhea; disease severity; educational status; employment; family size; female; fever; food insecurity; food security; groups by age; health survey; hemoglobin blood level; household; human; infant; inflammation; iron deficiency anemia; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; married woman; obesity; Pakistan; preschool child; prevalence; residence characteristics; retinol deficiency; risk factor; rural area; sanitation; secondary analysis; software; vitamin D deficiency; wealth distribution; zinc deficiency; anemia; complication; nutrition; pregnancy; prevalence; risk factor","Z.A.

It disproportionately affects developing countries through food insecurity. Greenhouse is important and relevant to the food-energy-water security in many regions. This study investigates the thermal behavior of photovoltaic evaporative cooling greenhouse made with eco-friendly coolers. The cooling potential of local plant materials was assessed under ambient conditions. Experimental thermal data obtained from optimized evaporative cooling system equipped with Hyphaene thebaica fibers (HF-pad) and conventional Celdek pad (C-pad), were used in heat and mass transfer equations to derive the greenhouse cooling performances. Computational fluid dynamics analysis software was used to investigate the refrigerant fluid distribution in the greenhouse. Cooler using HF-pad allows to keep the microclimate below 25 °C, with maximum moisture rate up to 80%, under harsh ambient conditions (temperature: 30–45 °C, humidity: 10–15%). HF-pad had the highest cooling coefficient of performance (COP = 9 against 6 for C-pad), the best cost to efficiency ratio (CER = 5; 4 times less than C-pad) and the lowest outlet temperature (20.0 °C). Due to higher outlet air velocity (1.116 m/s against 0.825 m/s for HF-pad), C-pad cooler spread cool air (20.5 °C) up to 1.25 m farther than its counterpart, creating higher pressure in the atmosphere (1.42 Pa against 0.71 Pa), with 2 times turbulent kinetic energy (0.014 J/kg). HF-pad presented cooling performances that compete with conventional pads. Moreover, optimization of HF-pad frame engineering and the technology scaling up to industrial level can allow better thermal and economic performances. © The Author(s) 2024.","","water; article; atmosphere; climate change; computational fluid dynamics; controlled study; cooling; cooling system; cost effectiveness analysis; drought; extreme weather; flooding; food insecurity; greenhouse; heat wave; humidity; kinetics; microclimate; moisture; pharmaceutics; Sahel; scale up; temperature; velocity","A.S.M.

In India, there are limited food insecurity assessment studies using a conventionally accepted method like the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). This study aims to measure food insecurity using the FIES and explore its determinants and association with body mass index (BMI) among Indian adults. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we used FIES to measure food security in a sample of 9005 adults residing in North and South India. Using questionnaires, socio-demographic factors, dietary intake and food security data were collected. The dietary diversity scores (FAO-IDDS) and food insecurity scores (FAO-FIES) were calculated. Body size was measured and BMI was calculated. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 52.4 years (± 11.7); half were women and half resided in rural areas. Around 10% of the participants reported having experienced (mild or moderate or severe) food insecurity between October 2018 and February 2019. Dietary diversity (measured by FAO’s Individual Dietary Diversity Scores, IDDS) was low and half of the participants consumed ≤ 3 food groups/day. The mean BMI was 24.7 kg/m2. In the multivariate analysis, a lower IDDS and BMI were associated with a higher FIES. The place of residence, gender and wealth index were important determinants of FIES, with those residing in South India, women and those belonging to the poorest wealth index reporting higher food insecurity. Conclusion: Food security is understudied in India. Our study adds important evidence to the literature. Despite having marginal food insecurity, high prevalence of low diet quality, especially among women, is disconcerting. Similar studies at the national level are warranted to determine the food insecurity situation comprehensively in India and plan appropriate policy actions to address it effectively, to attain the key Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","BMI; Dietary diversity; Food insecurity; Indian adults","Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Insecurity; Food Supply; Humans; India; Male; Middle Aged; Socioeconomic Factors; adult; article; body mass; body size; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diet; dietary intake; female; food insecurity; food security; gender; human; human experiment; human tissue; India; Indian; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prevalence; questionnaire; residence characteristics; rural area; sociodemographics; sustainable development goal; United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization; catering service; epidemiology; India; socioeconomics","S.

There are presently 657,628 Syrian refugees registered in Jordan nine years after the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic began. The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on pregnant women, nursing mothers, and most families with small children regarding food and nutrition security. It affected refugees worldwide. This review focuses on Syrian refugees' nutritional intake and the factors influencing their dietary habits, eating habits, and food insecurity. Due to system interdependencies, these impacts have cascaded across different components of the humanitarian aid provision system and led to risks of deterred personal growth and longer-term risks on the future leadership of the refugee community. The methodology followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A structured search of two databases-PubMed and Google Scholar—was carried out, and articles were identified that focused upon the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on food and nutrition security and dietary habits among refugees in camps. From this study, we recommend devising an interdisciplinary framework for assessing the education, protection, food security and household needs of the refugee communities together rather than intervening discreetly, and using the food security and household component of the system as the ladder to achieve effective management of pandemic-borne risks for the community. © 2023 The Author(s).

It is, in fact, one of the most significant concerns of the 21st century. According to the United Nations, nearly one in every three people, or 2.3 billion people worldwide, experienced a moderate to severe degree of food insecurity in 2021. As a result, there is a rising recognition of the critical need for successfully identifying, monitoring, and improving the food security of vulnerable populations. An effective method for anticipating the degree to which a region may be considered food insecure, however, is required before attempting to launch remedies for such a situation. To this end, we propose a novel machine learning-based spatial index in this article for estimating the degree of food insecurity experienced by a population. A real-world case study pertaining to South Africa is presented which demonstrates the applicability of our modelling approach. In particular, our roadmap designed towards developing the index is based on a spatial analysis of the study region and the construction of an appropriate data set. Following that, the strength of machine learning algorithms is harnessed to estimate the risk of food insecurity. Finally, the results of the aforementioned components are analysed to determine the causes and features of food insecure regions. The demonstration of the roadmap presented in this article exhibits promising results in its ability to classify 92.3% of food-insecure regions in South Africa correctly, thereby potentially supporting decision makers in their quest to improve food security policies and programmes. The research presented here may, in future, be extended by including additional descriptive features in the data set, increasing decision support utility through actionable recommendations, and exploring the temporal aspect of food security by incorporating cross-sectional data. © 2023 The Authors","Food poverty; Food security; Geographical information systems; Machine learning; Risk modelling","","F.

This research investigates the relationship between mental and health care in Albanian adults in 2023, mainly focusing on how they monitor their personal and economic well-being concerning their educational levels. The study's methodology consists of using an online survey followed by a crosstabulation analysis. Findings showed no difference in the perceptions of mental health care despite the levels of education; however, there is some significant relationship between the high school level of education and physical health care. When monitoring the economy, there is no significant difference concerning educational levels. There is a clear disposition that all adults, despite their level of education, provide the same importance to the economy. Our research findings highlight a high level of reaction regarding the economy rather than psychological care, which in most cases is stigmatised when mentioned. © 2023 Besmira Lahi and Ines Nurja.","Albania; COVID-19; economy; mental health; psychological counselling; psychological reactions","","","","Richtmann Publishing Ltd","2239978X","","","","English","J.

The current study explored the perceived psychological distress and consequent health outcomes caused by COVID-19. The Narrative Thematic Analysis design was employed. Eighteen participants comprising 12 males and 6 females responded about their experiences of the recent outbreak of COVID-19. The data were collected through a telephonic semi-structured interview which was analyzed through the Thematic Analysis Method. Four themes were generated: maladaptive psychological outcomes of COVID-19, perceived poor social support, increased religious practices, and the development of physical health symptoms. Extreme anxiety, panic experiences, insecurity, helplessness, hyper-vigilance, and negative attributions represented the psychological distress, while decreased social interactions and imposed social distancing characterized the perceived social support. Increased reliance on myths, divine interpretations, and faith in God showed religious practices. Decreased hunger, insomnia, headache, breathing problems, and palpitation were some ill-health outcomes. The pandemic shaped the nature and extent of perceived psychological distress, social support, and religious practices. The first two may have caused negative health and well-being outcomes while the religious practices maintained equilibrium among the rest three. Immediate trans-disciplinary efforts for the effective prevention, treatment, and promotion of the affected people are recommended. Positive health practices embedded in different socio-cultural systems may also be explored to help people facing the negative consequences of the recent and future pandemics. The implications and limitations of the study have been discussed. © 2023, Gyanesh Kumar Tiwari, Pramod Kumar Rai, Abhigyan Dwivedi, Bablu Ray, Ashutosh Pandey, Rakesh Pandey Licence CC-BY-SA 4.0.","COVID-19 pandemic; Narrative thematic analysis; Psychological distress & health outcomes; Religious practices; Social support","","G.K.

There is strong evidence from research that climate change will impact several food chain-related elements such as agricultural output, incomes, prices, food access, food quality, and food safety. This scoping review seeks to outline the state of knowledge of the food supply chain's vulnerability to climate change and to identify existing literature that may guide future research, policy, and decision-making aimed at enhancing the resilience of the food supply chain. A total of 1526 publications were identified using the SCOPUS database, of which 67 were selected for the present study. The vulnerability assessment methods as well as the adaptation and resilience measures that have been employed to alleviate the impact of climate change in the food supply chain were discussed. The results revealed a growing number of publications providing evidence of the weakening of the food supply chain due to climate change and extreme weather events. Our assessment demonstrated the need to broaden research into the entire food supply chain and various forms of climatic variability because most studies have concentrated on the relationships between climatic fluctuations (especially extreme rainfall, temperatures, and drought) and production. A lack of knowledge about the effects of climate change on the food supply chain and the underlying socio-economic consequences could result in underperformance or failure of the food supply chain. © 2024 The Authors","Adaptation; Climate change; Food supply chain; Resilience; Vulnerability","Agriculture; Climate Change; Droughts; Food Supply; Temperature; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Supply chains; bioethanol; biogas; fertilizer; green manure; mycotoxin; oleic acid; palm oil; pesticide; Adaptation; Agricultural output; Food chain; Food quality; Food supply chain; Food-safety; Quality safety; Resilience; Scoping review; Vulnerability; adaptive management; climate change; extreme event; food supply; supply chain management; vulnerability; abiotic stress; anaerobic digestion; animal food; climate change; climate change vulnerability; crop management; crop rotation; cropping system; decision making; drought; drought stress; evapotranspiration; extreme weather; food access; food availability; food chain; food contamination; food industry; food insecurity; food intake; food quality; food safety; food supply chain; food waste; greenhouse gas; marine environment; nonhuman; photosynthesis; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; productivity; publication; Review; salinity; soil erosion; soil fertility; soil quality; species distribution; telecommunication; temperature; temperature stress; vulnerability; water availability; water insecurity; agriculture; catering service; procedures; Climate change","H.

The dataset on water-related conflict-cooperation events compiled in this study extends to 2019, updating previous datasets that covered only up to 2008, yielding important new insights on cooperation-conflict trends. Global and regional trends were analyzed using the new events dataset, together with changes in hydroclimatic variables and population density. The analysis revealed that water-related cooperation was far more common than conflicts across all regions, in both drier and wetter climates, indicating that abundance and lack of water can both promote cooperation. However, conflict events were more common in drier climates where water is scarcer. This cooperation-conflict balance shifted in the 2000s, with conflict events increasing, to outnumber cooperation events in 2017. The main shift occurred in Africa and Asia, where increased conflicts in Africa coincided with a prolonged period of below-average precipitation and severe drought, while the shift in Asia coincided with increased evapotranspiration caused by human activities and increased population density. Differences between regions were confirmed by event descriptions, with events in Africa relating to water access and farmer-herder conflicts, and events in Asia relating to irrigation and dam construction. These differences highlight the need for regional-scale analysis of water-related conflict-cooperation trends and pathways. With climate change and human activities expected to increase, the increasing trend in conflict events could persist, with water resources becoming a more frequent cause of future conflict. Identifying these complex cooperation-conflict changes is vital in determining future actions required to reduce conflict events and promote cooperation on water. © 2023 The Authors","Climate change; Database; Drought; Human conflict; Hydroclimatic changes; Water security","Africa; Climate Change; Droughts; Humans; Water; Water Resources; Drought; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Water resources; water; Change trends; Conflict and cooperation; Historical trends; Human activities; Human conflict; Hydroclimatic; Hydroclimatic change; Multiple disciplines; Population densities; Water security; climate change; conflict management; data set; database; drought; historical geography; hydrometeorology; nature-society relations; population density; precipitation (climatology); trend analysis; water management; water supply; Africa; agricultural worker; Article; Asia; climate change; cooperation; dam (barrier); drought; evapotranspiration; herd; human activities; hydroclimate; information processing; irrigation (agriculture); population density; precipitation; social conflict; trend study; water insecurity; water management; water supply; human; water supply; Climate change","E.

Aim: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify and collate evidence on food insecurity in adults with SMI, in high- and upper-middle income countries. Method: A comprehensive electronic search was completed up to August 2022. Random effects meta-analysis was undertaken to determine the prevalence and the odds ratio for food insecurity in adults with SMI. Narrative synthesis explored the data further. Results: Sixteen publications were included (13 in the meta-analysis). The prevalence estimate of food insecurity in adults with SMI was 41% (95% CI: 29% to 53%, I2 = 99.9%, n = 13). Adults with SMI were 3.31 (95% CI: 2.03 to 5.41) times more likely to experience food insecurity than comparators without SMI (z = 6.29, p <.001, I2 = 98.9%, n = 6). Food insecurity appears to be a risk factor for developing SMI. Discussion: This review suggests adults with SMI living in high- or upper-middle income countries are more likely to experience food insecurity than the general population and that this relationship may be inverse. Implications for practice: Mental health practitioners should be aware of food insecurity and support individuals with SMI to access sufficient food. © 2023 The Authors.

Its constant increase during the last months is subject of major concern for both citizens and policy makers, as individuals might experience increased feelings of job insecurity due to the pandemic context and to the latest developments on the job market. Job insecurity refers to a perceived threat to the continuity and stability of employment as it is currently experienced and has a negative impact on the individuals’ quality of life. Many researches have linked job insecurity with low levels of well-being and high levels of stress, as well as local or national measures taken in job creation and job retention. Aside from individual factors, there are other critical influences that should be considered in order to better understand the dynamics of job insecurity against the COVID-19 pandemic. Such influences can come from regional features such as spatial, economic, or demographic characteristics, like gender, age, or education. The aim of the paper is to identify and spatially represent the variations and evolution of job insecurity during the on-going pandemic. Our analyses are based on the PsyCorona database (15.311 participants), a study with self-reported data deployed in countries all around the world, that monitored various psychological variables during the first pandemic waves. For the purpose of this research, data related to the first wave (March-July 2020) was selected. In order to get a better understanding of the spatial distribution of self-reported job insecurity, we chose to focus on eight European countries (France, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Italy). Respondents from Western Europe countries expressed lower scores on self-reported job insecurity and less variance over time while those from Southern and Eastern Europe displayed higher scores for job insecurity and more variance. Moreover, we found that the higher the overall job insecurity is perceived in a country, the higher the discrepancies between age, gender, and education categories tend to be. © The Author(s) 2023.","core-periphery; COVID-19 pandemic; Europe; job insecurity","France; Germany; Greece; Italy; Netherlands; Romania; Spain; United Kingdom; core-periphery relations; COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; quality of life; unemployment","A.

Quantifying the temporal and spatial patterns of snowpack accumulation and its subsequent melt and runoff is an internationally significant challenge, particularly within mountainous regions featuring complex terrain with limited or absent observational data. Here we report a new approach to snowpack characterization using open-source global satellite and modelled data products (precipitation and SWE) greatly enhancing the utility of the widely used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The paper focusses on the c. 23,000 km2 Chenab river basin (CRB) in the headwaters of the Indus Basin, globally important because of its large and growing population and increasing water insecurity due to climate change. We used five area-weighted averaged satellite, gridded and reanalysis precipitation datasets: ERA5-Land, CMORPH, TRMM, APHRODITE and CPC UPP. As well as comparison to local weather station data, these were used in SWAT to model streamflow for evaluation against observed streamflow at the basin outlet. ERA5-Land data provided the best streamflow match-ups and was used to infer snowpack (SWE) dynamics at basin and sub-basin scales. Snow reference data were derived from remote sensing and modelled SWE re-analysis products: ULCA-SWE and KRA-SWE, respectively. Beyond conventional auto-calibration and single-variable approaches we undertook multi-variable calibration using R-SWAT to manually adjust snow parameters alongside observed streamflow data. Characterization of basin-wide patterns of snowpack build-up and melt (SWE dynamics) were greatly strengthened using KRA-SWE data accompanied by improved streamflow simulation in sub-basins dominated by seasonal snow cover. UCLA-SWE data also improved SWE estimations using R-SWAT but weakened the performance of simulated streamflow due to under capture of seasonal runoff from permanent snow/ice fields in the CRB. This research highlights the utility and value of remote sensing and modelling data to drive better understanding of snowpack dynamics and their contribution to runoff in the absence of in situ snowpack data in high-altitude environments. An improved understanding of snow-bound water is vital in natural hazard risk assessment and in better managing worldwide water resources in the populous downstream regions of mountain-fed large rivers under threat from climate change. © 2024 by the authors.","global precipitation products; multi-variable calibration; remote sensing; snow water equivalent; SWAT","Calibration; Climate change; Digital storage; Floods; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Remote sensing; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Snow; Stream flow; Uncertainty analysis; Global precipitation; Global precipitation product; Multi variables; Multi-variable calibration; Precipitation products; Reanalysis; Remote-sensing; River basins; Snow water equivalent; Soil and Water assessment tools; SWAT","J.H.

Majority of the discussion have focused on growing crop yield which has continuously sustained a vital approach to lessen food insecurity. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that adequate food is presently produced per capita to nourish the population worldwide but yet a reasonable population suffers from food insecurity especially in under-developed republics. Fulfillment of upcoming food request will be more intricate by harmful variations in climate and other ecological influences, global climate change. This current paper presents true picture of a food systems method to investigate the multifaceted food security arena and highlights numerous substitutes to cop up this situation. These encompass (i) giving a outline for organizing discussions intended at increasing food security and recognizing the variety of interested parties who should be intricate; (ii) participating studies of the complete network of food system doings starting from crop harvesting to consumption of the produced food by those of the food security results i.e. continuous supply chain over yearly, consumption and accessibility rather tan merely focusing on crop production (iii) serving to both evaluate the effects of global ecological conservation on food systems and find responses to the earth system from food system activities; (iv) helping to identify intervention points for enhancing food security and examining interactions and trade-offs between bionetwork facilities and food security, and community welfare results of diverse adaptation paths; and motivation of health-care institution for augmentation of human health services (v) pinpointing where innovative study is desired. © 2024 Society for Innovative Agriculture, University of Agriculture.

These parasites cause a variety of symptoms, including anemia. Methods: In May 2023, fecal and blood samples were collected from children aged 6 to 11 years attending government run (public) elementary schools in the Simanindo and Ronggur Nihuta sub-districts of Samosir Island, Indonesia where a twice a year mass drug administration (MDA) program is currently in place. A questionnaire was administered to students' parents or adult family members on possible risk factors for STH infections. Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Results: In total, 187 and 221 children in Simanindo and Ronggur Nihuta provided samples, respectively. The STH infection prevalence in Simanindo was 4.8% (9/187) and the infection prevalence in Ronggur Nihuta was 5.9% (13/221). In Simanindo, all infections were caused by Trichuris trichiura (n = 9), and in Ronggur Nihuta infections were caused by Ascaris lumbricoides (n = 6), Trichuris trichiura (n = 5), and A. lumbricoides + T. trichiura (n = 2). Three children had anemia but were negative for STH infections. While the results of the parent/adult questionnaires indicated access to a generally safe water supply and septic system, information from the in-depth interviews and focus groups revealed that the local water supply becomes greatly diminished during the dry season. Conclusions: While MDA has been shown to effectively control roundworms and hookworms, additional measures to control trichuriasis are needed. There is also a need for the government to invest in improving the public water supply infrastructure. © 2024","anemia; Indonesia; Samosir; school-age children; Soil-transmitted helminth infection","adult; anemia; Article; ascariasis; blood sampling; child; clinical article; controlled study; dry season; elementary student; feces; female; geographic distribution; government; health program; helminthiasis; human; Indonesia; infection risk; information processing; interview; male; mass drug administration; parasite transmission; parent; prevalence; primary school; qualitative analysis; questionnaire; risk factor; Samosir Island; school child; soil transmitted helminth infection; trichuriasis; water insecurity; water supply","I.E.

Although the production of genetically modified (GM) plant-based crops has been adopted in South Africa (SA), and available for human consumption, a dearth of research exists in respect of SA consumers’ knowledge of, and the influences that affect the purchase of GM food products. An exploratory survey study design included 326 consumers, purposefully selected through snowball sampling from Mooi river, in KwaZulu-Natal province, SA. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to identify underlying drivers for the knowledge and influences on the purchase decisions of GM food products. It was found that although respondents were aware of GM food products and understood the meaning of “genetically modified”, they lacked general knowledge about GM food products, reflected in the minimal scope of their knowledge and uncertainty of GM components present in food products as identified through an EFA. Consideration for purchasing would include the potential to increase food supplies, the reduced usage of pesticides, carcinogenic effects, allergenicity, harmful effect on the environment, longer shelf life and the unnatural development of GM food products. Through EFA, consumption and production implications, consumer advantages, product identification elements, and agricultural pesticide practices were underlying drivers of the influencers of consumers’ GM food product purchasing decisions. Food insecurity could persist if GM consumer education is not re-introduced in SA to address consumer apathy and sense of disengagement towards GM food products. This is attributed to the limited consumer knowledge about GM food products. This study has contributed towards a better understanding of the current consumer perspective on GM food products and what it will take to turn the GM food product aversion into informed consumer decisions and practices. Future research in SA is needed to determine the demographic profile of consumers and how that will influence GM food product purchases in the wake of addressing food security. © 2023, African Scholarly Science Communications Trust (ASSCAT).

We analyzed data from 73 countries using the Global School-based Student Health Survey (283,233 adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age). Leisure sitting time and weekly frequency of PE classes were self-reported. Sex, age, and food insecurity were used as covariates and the analyses were stratified by world regions and country income level. Poisson regression models (random-effects meta-analysis) were used for the main analyses. In comparison with 1 PE class per week (reference group), those with no PE classes presented a lower prevalence of ≥ 3 h/d of leisure sitting time (PR [95%CI] = 0.94 [0.91; 0.98]). On the other hand, adolescents with 2 days (PR [95%CI] = 1.06 [1.02; 1.26]), 3–4 days (PR [95%CI] = 1.17 [1.12; 1.22]), and 5 days (PR [95%CI] = 1.08 [1.04; 1.11]) of PE classes presented a higher likelihood of ≥ 3 h/d of leisure sitting time. No clear differences were observed for the different world regions and country income levels. We conclude that a higher weekly frequency of PE classes is associated with increased leisure sitting time among adolescents worldwide. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Health Behavior; Health Education; School Health Services","Adolescent; Health Behavior; Humans; Leisure Activities; Physical Education and Training; Sedentary Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; adolescent; health behavior; human; leisure; meta analysis; physical education; questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle","D.R.

Anemia remains a leading contributor to years lived with disability (YLDs), being responsible for 50.3 million (5.82%) YLDs worldwide and 19.3 million (12.03%) YLDs in India, respectively. Results of the National Family Health Survey 2019-2021 (NFHS-5) suggest a high burden of anemia in India among women of reproductive age and children aged 6-59 months at the national level (57%, 67.1%), and in the state of Bihar, India (63.5%, 69.4%). Iron deficiency is the leading cause, accounting for more than half the cases. Anemia bodes harmful implications for both the mother and child, with long-lasting consequences for the latter. Anemia control programs have yielded little benefit despite efforts stretching over five decades. This narrative review aims to highlight the burden of anemia and the probable factors behind it among under-5 children and women of reproductive age in the Indian state of Bihar. Material and methods. The paper is a narrative review. The following databases were used to search and select literature: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. In addition, the websites of relevant government departments and national health programs were searched for pertinent material. Analysis of the literature. A multitude of reasons seem to be behind the unabated high prevalence in Bihar: low socioeconomic status, gender disparities, traditional customs and practices, food insecurity, lack of diverse diets, poor consumption, and no adherence to iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements, groundwater contamination with arsenic and fluoride, and supply chain mismanagement, all playing roles of varying degree. Conclusion. An all-encompassing approach and not merely the provision of IFA supplements are necessary to unravel the intricate web of factors that lead to anemia. © 2023 The Author(s).","anemia; diet habits; heavy metal toxicity; iron deficiency anemia; maternal child health services; socioeconomic factors","arsenic; fluoride; folic acid; ground water; iron; adolescent; anemia; child; child development; family health; female; food insecurity; food security; gender inequality; government; health survey; hemoglobin blood level; human; India; infant; information system; iron deficiency; postpartum hemorrhage; prevalence; priority journal; public health; Review; social status; water contamination; work capacity","S.

Understanding the relationships between forest structure and function is essential for managing dryland forests to adapt to these changes. We investigated the structure-function relationships in four dryland conifer forests distributed along a semiarid to subhumid climatic aridity gradient. Forest structure was represented by leaf area index (LAI) and function by gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and the derived efficiencies of water use (WUE = GPP/ET) and leaf area (LAE = GPP/LAI). Estimates of GPP and ET were based on the observed relationships between high-resolution vegetation indices from VENμS and Sentinel-2A satellites and flux data from three eddy covariance towers in the study regions between November 2015 to October 2018. The red-edge-based MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) from VENμS and Sentinel-2A showed strong correlations to flux tower GPP and ET measurements for the three sites (R2cal > 0.91, R2val > 0.84). Using our approach, we showed that as LAI decreased with decreasing aridity index (AI) (i.e., dryer conditions), estimated GPP and ET decreased (R2 > 0.8 to LAI), while WUE (R2 = 0.68 to LAI) and LAE increased. The observed global-scale patterns are associated with a variety of forest vegetation characteristics, at the local scale, such as tree species composition and density. However, our results point towards a canopy-level mechanism, where the ecosystem-LAI and resultant proportion of sun-exposed vs. shaded leaves are primary determinants of WUE and LAE along the studied climatic aridity gradient. This work demonstrates the importance of high-resolution (spatially and spectrally) remote sensing data conjugated with flux tower data for monitoring dryland forests and understanding the intricate structure-function interactions in their response to drying conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration (ET); Gross primary productivity (GPP); MODIS; Sentinel-2A; VENμS","Ecosystem; Forests; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Seasons; Tracheophyta; Water; Climate change; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Water supply; water; Dry land; Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration; Gross primary productivity; Leaf Area Index; MODIS; Sentinel-2a; VENμS; Water use; aridity; assessment method; coniferous forest; dryland farming; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; forest canopy; leaf area index; MODIS; primary production; satellite data; Sentinel; water use; Article; bandwidth; climate change; conifer; controlled study; correlation analysis; desert climate; drought stress; dryland forest; Eddy covariance; environmental monitoring; evapotranspiration; flux assay; forest dynamics; forest management; forest structure; gross primary productivity; leaf area; MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index; MODIS satellite; nonhuman; plant community; plant density; plant parameters; plant product; plant water use; remote sensing; satellite imagery; semiarid climate; shade tolerance; species composition; sun exposure; vegetation; water insecurity; ecosystem; forest; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; season; vascular plant; Evapotranspiration","T.

Despite high rates of FI among refugees in HIC, little is known about FSN status of refugees and asylum-seekers living in refugee camps in the European Union- EU. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by reviewing issues related to the Food Security and Nutrition-FSN of refugees in the EU and worldwide and provides three main contributions to the existing knowledge. Firstly, it identifies the main drivers of FSN in a refugee context and offer a causal framework describing the main causes and effects of FNI in refugee camps. The immediate causes of FNI are poor Shelter and Settlement, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene and Healthcare. Moreover, secondary causes of FNI are the lack of adaptation to a new environment; Lack of culturally adapted food; Inadequate FSN interventions; Poor livelihood strategies. Secondly, it demonstrates that FNI exists in European refugee camps underscoring that EU member states have been unable to deliver sustainable solutions towards the realization of FSN in the E.U. Finally, the paper calls for a multisectoral and non-discriminatory European common policy targeting refugees’ FSN. © The Author(s) 2024.","Asylum seekers; Food policy; Food security and nutrition; Refugee camp; Refugees","European Union; food policy; food security; livelihood; nutrition; refugee","L.F.

In response to this crisis, this comprehensive review systematically maps the existing literature concerning sustainability and resilience within the realm of food security. A meticulous categorization of the identified papers is performed, focusing on elucidating the underlying causes of food insecurity, assessing their profound impacts on public health, delineating the requisite strategies and actions, and discerning the commonalities and distinctions between sustainability and resilience. Systematic searches across reputable databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Springer, were conducted to retrieve pertinent papers published from 2019 to 2022, specifically addressing the threats to food security in the post-pandemic landscape. From an initial pool of 105 papers, 26 met the stringent inclusion criteria for subsequent in-depth analysis and categorization, employing thematic content analysis to elucidate their thematic focus on causative factors, repercussions, mitigation strategies, and intersections between sustainability and resilience. Drawing insights from the amalgamated findings, this study proposes a holistic, systematic conceptualization for integrating sustainability and resilience principles within the food sector. This structure offers a roadmap for fortifying food security, ultimately advancing the cause of public health and well-being. It is poised to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, facilitating the exploration of sustainability and resilience in the context of food supply chains and providing policymakers with actionable insights for implementing these vital approaches. © 2024 by the authors.","food security; mitigation strategies; post-pandemic; resilience; supply chains; sustainability; thematic analysis","COVID-19; food security; food supply; mitigation; public health; resilience; strategic approach; supply chain management; sustainability","M.

Locust management and control have led to less frequent and intense plagues and outbreaks worldwide. However, political insecurity and armed conflicts affect locust management, and can as well as changing climate, and land use management contribute to new outbreaks. In the context of the increasing world population and higher demand for agricultural production, locust pests will remain of high concern. Geospatial and remote sensing data have become an important source of information for different applications within locust research and management. However, there is still a gap between available information and actual practical usage. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of geospatial and remote sensing data and how this information can be prepared for a straightforward application for stakeholders. For this purpose, we use the h3-hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system to simplify and structure spatial information into standardized hexagon units. The presented concept provides decision makers and ground teams with a simplified information database that contains area-wide information over time and space and can be used without detailed geospatial knowledge and background. The concept is designed for the use case of Italian locust management in the Pavlodar region (Kazakhstan) and based on actual practices. It can be extrapolated to any other study area or species of interest. Our results underline the importance of actual land management on locust presence. Up-to-date land management information can be derived from time-series analyses of remote sensing data. Furthermore, essential meteorological data are used to generate locust-specific climatic characteristics within the h3-system. Within this system, areal prioritizing for locust management can be achieved based on the included spatial information and experience from ongoing practices. © 2023 The Author(s)","Calliptamus italicus; Earth observation; Food security; GIS; Insect pests; Locust; Outbreak; Plague; Remote sensing; Risk assessment","Kazakhstan; Pavlodar; GIS; locust; pest control; pest outbreak; remote sensing; risk assessment; spatial data","I.

The presence of several pollutants, including heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and pathogens, in water resources underscores a pressing global concern, prompting the European Union (EU) to establish a Water Watch List to monitor the level of these substances. Nowadays, the standard methods used to detect and quantify these contaminants are mainly liquid or gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/GC–MS). While these methodologies offer precision and accuracy, they require expensive equipment and experienced technicians, and cannot be used on the field. In this context, chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs)-based sensors have emerged as promising, user-friendly, practical, and portable tools for environmental monitoring. QDs are semiconductor nanocrystals that possess excellent properties, and have demonstrated versatility across various sensor types, such as fluorescent, electrochemical, plasmonic, and colorimetric ones.

This paper utilized the Alkire-Foster (AF) method to compute the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) and analyze the incidence and intensity of multidimensional poverty among urban households in Kenya. The findings indicated that 8.7 % of urban households are multidimensionally deprived in 33.3 % of the selected dimensional indicators. Also, the results showed that over 50 % of urban households are deprived of drinking water and sanitation services. In addition, the findings revealed that higher poverty incidence, intensity, and urban multidimensional poverty exist among female-headed households, old household headships, and households residing in peri-urban regions. The Probit regression analysis indicated that large household size, number of children under five years, household head age, gender, marital status, urban food insecurity, health status, and residing in Malaria endemic zone are significant positive predictors of urban multidimensional poverty. On the other hand, an increase in the number of educated women, owners of insurance coverage, agricultural land, and wealthy and home-owning households is linked to a decline in urban multidimensional poverty. The paper professes that policymakers should cautiously consider household socioeconomic differences while designing poverty alleviation policies. © 2024 The Author","Kenya; Multidimensional poverty; Probit regression; Urban household characteristics","","I.

Under nutrition is a worldwide health issue, especially among pregnant women. Malnutrition during pregnancy can result in miscarriages, fetal deaths during pregnancy, preterm delivery, and maternal mortality for both the mother and her fetus. Therefore, this research aimed to assess the prevalence of under nutrition and associated factors among pregnant woman attending antenatal care services at public hospitals in west Ethiopia. Objective To assess the prevalence of under nutrition and associated factors among pregnant women attending Antenatal Care service in Public Hospitals of western Ethiopia. Methods Facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 10 to May 10, 2020 among 780 pregnant mothers. The study participants were selected by systematic random sampling methods from antenatal care clinics of the hospitals. Interviewer administered structured questionnaire was used to collect the data and Mid-upper arm circumference, height and weight were measured to determine the magnitude of under nutrition among the study participants. The data were entered to Epi Info version 7.2.3, and then exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors considering adjusted odd ratio (AOR) at p-value ≤ 0.05 to measure the strength of association between dependent and independent variables. Result The prevalence of under nutrition among pregnant women was found to be 39.2% (95%CI: 35.7%, 42.6%). Rural residence [(AOR = 1.97, 95% CI: (1.24, 3.14)], substance use [(AOR: 3.33, 95% CI: (1.63, 6.81)], low dietary diversity of women [(AOR = 7.56, 95% CI: (4.96, 11.51)], mildly food insecure household [(AOR = 4.36, 95% CI: (2.36, 8.79)], moderately food insecure household [(AOR = 3.71, 95%CI: (1.54, 8.79), and severely food insecure household [(AOR = 6.96, 95% CI: (3.15, 15.42)] were factors significantly associated with under nutrition. Conclusion The study showed that the prevalence of under nutrition is very high among pregnant women. Factors associated with under nutrition of pregnant women were rural residency, household food insecurity, dietary diversity and substance use. All concerned bodies should made efforts to reduce the risk of under nutrition by reducing substance use and improving household food security there by to increase women’s dietary diversity. © 2023 Tafara et al.

To date, there has been no evaluation of how national food availability may associate with the incidence and mortality of these tumors. Correspondingly, the aim of this study was to define if such associations exist. Methods: The most updated incidence and mortality rates of CNS tumors in pediatric patients were abstracted by country from the Global Burden of Disease database. Data regarding food availability parameters were identified and abstracted from the Food Systems Dashboard database. Associations were tested using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results: There were sufficient data in a total of 175 countries worldwide describing the required outcomes. Median incidence and mortality rates across these countries were 1.63 per 100,000 and 0.80 per 100,000, respectively. Higher incidence rates of pediatric CNS tumors were statistically associated with lower availability of fruit and vegetables (P = 0.02), higher average protein supply (P < 0.01), lower share of dietary energy from cereal and roots (P < 0.01), lower supply of meat (P < 0.01), lower supply of nuts and seeds (P < 0.01), lower supply of vegetable oils (P < 0.01), and higher supply of vegetables (P < 0.01). Higher mortality rates due to pediatric CNS tumors were statistically associated with lower availability of fruit and vegetables (P = 0.048), lower supply of fish (P = 0.046), and lower supply of nuts and seeds (P = 0.04). When categorizing countries based on income status, there was a decrease in significant associations found more pronounced in low-middle income countries. Conclusions: There are many novel associations between national food availability and the incidence and mortality rates of pediatric CNS tumors across the world, which may be more pronounced and divergent in low-middle income countries. A greater understanding is needed to identify what specific components of the significant parameters influence these trends and how public health efforts may best address these associations to improve overall outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.

The abstract of the article is given below: Abstract In low-income countries, there exists a common concern about the effect of hunger and food insecurity on educational outcomes. However, income inequalities, economic slowdown, conflict, and climate change have raised those concerns globally. Yet, little is known about how widespread the problem of hunger in schools is worldwide. This study examines child hunger and student achievement internationally, using data from the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2019. To examine the relationship between hunger and student achievement, we fitted multilevel models to the data and controlled for student SES, class SES, teacher experience, and teacher educational attainment. The results suggest that hunger among students is not exclusive to low-income countries. Instead, child hunger is a common issue around the world, affecting about onethird of children and exacerbating unequal education opportunities globally. Controlling for other variables, the achievement gap between students who never come to school hungry and those who come to school always or almost always hungry is significant and deserves our attention. A clear policy recommendation from our results suggests that all countries that participated in TIMSS need to examine their school meal programs and explore ways to feed the students who show up to school hungry.

Urbanization has significantly impacted the supply, demand, and flow of freshwater ecosystem services due to various human activities. However, the changes in freshwater ecosystem service flow (FESF) under the influence of urbanization were still unclear. This study examines the highly urbanized Dongjiang River as an example and maps the supply-flow-demand network of freshwater services based on social-ecological network analysis. The results indicate that freshwater supply has increased by 0.21 billion m3 per year, while there is a decreasing trend of 0.17 billion m3 per year in demand. The FESF approach reveals that 42%–60% of imbalanced sub-watersheds rely on artificial water diversion projects to alleviate water deficits under dynamic flow conditions. Approximately 15.6% of the region experiences water insecurity, driven by urbanization-induced demand for water diversion. This increased demand puts stress on downstream sub-watershed water supply and elevates the risk of flow reduction in the main stream. The study highlights the need for sustainable water management strategies to ensure freshwater security in large river basins within urbanized areas worldwide and to address the challenges posed by uncertain urban expansion. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Freshwater ecosystem service flow; Social-ecological system; The Dongjiang River; Urbanization","China; Dong River [China]; human activity; socioeconomic status; Sustainable Development Goal; urban planning; urban population; urbanization; water management; watershed","Z.

This paper empirically explores to what extent older adults perceive themselves as part of a COVID-19 risk group and how these perceptions influence their everyday lives and experiences of age and ageing. This paper draws upon data from a mixed-methods study on older adults' risk perceptions during COVID-19 in Lower Austria, including a representative survey on 521 adults (60+ years) and data from 20 semi-structured interviews. Approximately two-thirds of the respondents consider themselves at risk of COVID-19 and name age, in addition to pre-existing illness, as a contributing factor in this risk perception. Older adults with health constraints, and especially older men, have a higher probability of perceiving risk due to COVID-19. Additionally, older adults report that they experience being 'suddenly seen as old' or 'being put into a box' during the pandemic, which influenced their experiences and images of ageing. Our study provides insights into how perceived COVID-19 risk affects the everyday lives of older adults. Age-based categorisations of risk contribute to a shift in images of age and ageing, drawing on insecurity and risk, rather than successful and active ageing, to conceptualise later life.

Older adults who experience economic insecurity may refrain from seeking medical consultation or using long-term care insurance, and these behaviors may increase the incidence and progression of frailty. This study conducted a cross-sectional survey to identify factors related to a sense of economic insecurity among older adults who participate in social activities, and identified support measures. In total, 1,351 older adults aged ≥65 years who had participated in social activities voluntarily completed an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire encompassed their physical, cognitive, social, and psychological conditions, and economic insecurity. We performed univariate analysis considering a sense of economic insecurity as the dependent variable, and conducted multiple logistic regression analysis (forced entry method) considering the independent variables with p<0.1 as the covariates. Among the 872 filled questionnaires, 717 were analyzed as they had no missing data with respect to the responses to survey questions (valid response rate was 53.1%). Analysis results showed that 43.6% of the older adults had a sense of economic insecurity, which was most common among those aged 75–84 years, accounting for 47.3%, followed by those aged 65–74 years accounting for 44.1%, and those aged ≥85 years accounting for 31.5% (p<0.05). The sense of economic insecurity was not associated with physical conditions, subjective symptoms of dementia, or social conditions; however, it grew with increased loneliness (OR: 1.71, 1.002–2.92, p = 0.049) and decreased with an increased subjective sense of well-being (OR: 0.86, 0.81–0.92, <0.001). Economic insecurity among older adults was not associated with physical, cognitive, or social aspects, as reported in previous studies. The survey respondents constituted older adults who participate in social activities. Maintaining interactions within the community, even in old age, may prevent loneliness and improve subjective health. © 2024 Inoue et al.

One of the reasons for this issue is that the regional distribution of water resources is inequitable worldwide. The water diversion is a potential way to ease the water shortages as a result of the unequal distribution of water resources. As is well known, the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) in China is the largest project of water diversion over the world, which is transferring water resources between two river basins. This paper analyses the economic impact of the water diversion with the example of the SNWDP. It was found that the economic status of the areas affected by the SNWDP increased, relative to other regions. This result is robust when estimating with alternative outcome measure or subsample, and with alternative methods. The mechanism analysis shows that the main reason for the increased economic development level is that the water diversion encourages growth of the service industry in the water-receiving areas by supplying water for domestic use. These results imply that the sectors with more value-added may benefit better from the water diversion. © 2024 IWA Publishing.

Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, maize, and oilseeds, staples that are now suffering a war-triggered supply risk. This paper describes the background of the problem and illustrates current trends by outlining some of the measures that may be deployed to mitigate the conflict’s impacts on achieving SDG 2 (Zero hunger), especially focusing on ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. In order to understand the main research strands in the literature that are related to food security in the context of wars, the authors adopted a bibliometric literature review based on the co-occurrence of terms technique, conducted with 631 peer-reviewed documents extracted from the Scopus database. To complement the bibliometric assessment, ten case studies were selected to narrow down the food insecurity aspects caused by the war in Ukraine. The co-occurrence analysis indicated four different thematic clusters. In the next stage, an assessment of the current situation on how war affects food security was carried out for each one of the clusters, and the reasons and possible solutions to food security were identified. Policy recommendations and theoretical implications for food security in the conflict context in Ukraine were also addressed. © 2023 by the authors.","agriculture; economics; food security; public policies; Ukraine; war","","M.

Climate assessments indicate that drought will affect the majority of world regions in the future, with agricultural-dependent communities bearing the brunt of its impacts. Therefore, managing measures to mitigate the effects of drought is crucial in this regard. This research aims to (1) examine the adoption status of adaptation strategies and (2) identify the influential factors affecting the adoption of drought mitigation measures in Iran. The study population consisted of all rural agricultural households in Kerman Province (southeastern Iran). In order to accurately select the studied samples, calculation of drought severity was done based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). In this research, an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), incorporating new variables including trust, self-efficacy, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risk, resistance to use, and performance expectancy, was utilized as the theoretical framework. Data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results revealed that all adaptation strategies of farmers under drought conditions were categorized into five classes: Social activities (SA), Physical infrastructure management (PIM), Financial management (FIM), Farm management (FM), Irrigation and water management (IWM), and Crop management (CM). Furthermore, SEM results indicated that all hypothesized relationships in this context were significant, and the research variables explained 58% of the variance in the adoption of adaptive behaviors. Lastly, considering that trust had the most significant effect on the adoption of adaptation measures, policymakers in this field are recommended to increase farmers’ trust in these strategies by conducting thorough needs assessments and identifying the most effective strategies. Moreover, organizing appropriate workshops and training courses can enhance farmers’ awareness and understanding of adaptation measures for mitigating the impacts of drought. © 2024 The Author(s)","Adaptation to drought; Climate change; Iran; Reducing the effects of drought; Sustainable livelihood","","M.

This article seeks to identify the psychosocial impact of the confinement period during the COVID-19 pandemic for the Colombian population by identifying profiles that predict the levels of different mental health indicators (feelings of fear, positive emotions or feelings during free time, and work impact) and based on them, characterize the risk factors and protection that allows us to propose guidelines for prevention or recovery from future health emergencies. Methods: This is an observational, cross-sectional, retrospective ex post facto study. Multistage cluster probabilistic sampling and binary logistic regression analysis were used to predict extreme levels of various mental health indicators based on psychosocial indicators of the COVID-19 confinement period and to identify risk and protection factors, Results: A relationship was established between the combination of some of the different psychosocial factors evaluated (this combination being the predictive profile identified) with each of the three main variables: feeling of fear (Formula presented.), positive emotions or feelings during free time (Formula presented.) and labour impact (Formula presented.), with social vulnerability determined by sociodemographic factors that were common in all profiles (sex, age, ethnicity and socioeconomic level) and conditions associated with job insecurity (unemployed, loss of health insurance and significant changes to job’s requirements) and place of residence (city). Conclusion: For future health emergencies, it is necessary to (i) mitigate the socio-employment impact from emergency containment measures in a scaled and differentiated manner at the local level, (ii) propose prevention and recovery actions through psychosocial and mental health care accessible to the entire population, especially vulnerable groups, (iii) Design and implement work, educational and recreational adaptation programs that can be integrated into confinement processes.

Energy projects have led to an increase in social divisiveness in certain countries. Hence, worldwide, governmental, and legislative entities-local, geographic, national, and global-exhibit significant apprehension over the environmental consequences and risk elements that shape the energy paradigms. Therefore, to mitigate and restrict the problems related to environmental insecurity, the globe must take prompt and efficient measures to safeguard the climate for a more promising future. It must actively seek alternate energy options while decreasing its reliance on petroleum-based energy sources. In light of this pressing matter, this research aims to showcase the capabilities of several RES, such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, and biomass. The research briefly summarizes energy-related issues and prospects, followed by a comparative analysis of RES and non-RES. A comprehensive overview of several Sustainable Energy Sources (SES), such as wind, solar, hydroelectricity, and biomass, is provided, accompanied by pertinent illustrations and statistical data on the global energy potential of each source.

However, urbanization can promote additional inputs of P into the soil that lead to saturation of the binding sites exceeding the maximum sorption capacity. Soils saturated with P act as important diffuse sources of pollution of water resources. The flow of P from the soil to aquatic ecosystems is an aggravating factor for water scarcity, especially in the semiarid region. Knowing phosphorus dynamics in the soil is essential to protect water quality and ensure its multiple uses. In this paper, a total of fifty soil samples, twenty-five from natural soils and twenty-five from urban soils, were evaluated for the effect of urbanization on P sorption characteristics and their relationship with the physical and chemical attributes of the soil. The soil samples were characterized physically and chemically, and the P sorption characteristics were obtained from the adjustment of Langmuir and Freundlich equations by nonlinear regression. Urbanization results in increased soil P saturation and reduced P sorption capacity. Our results show that the sandy texture of the soils studied had a standardizing effect on the soil's physical properties, maintaining, even after urbanization, the physical quality similar to natural soil. In contrast, pH (in water and KCl), base saturation, sodium saturation, potential acidity, exchangeable Al3+, exchangeable Mg2+, available P, and P-rem are valuable indicators in the segregation between natural and urban soils. The reduction of P sorption capacity in urban soils increases the risks related to P loads in aquatic ecosystems that experience urban expansion worldwide. These data serve as a basis for decision-making regarding the appropriate soil monitoring and management of urban expansion areas in watersheds to control P flow to aquatic systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Diffuse pollution; Isotherms; Phosphorus availability; Phosphorus sorption","Ecosystem; Phosphorus; Sand; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Urbanization; Water Quality; Aquatic ecosystems; Binding sites; Decision making; Expansion; Nonlinear equations; Phosphorus; Soil pollution; Textures; Tropics; Water pollution; Water quality; Water resources; aluminum; magnesium ion; phosphorus; potassium chloride; sodium; water; phosphorus; Diffuse pollution; Natural soils; Phosphorus availability; Phosphorus loss; Phosphorus sorption; Soil sample; Sorption capacities; Sorption characteristics; Urban expansion; Urban soils; isotherm; pH; phosphorus; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; sandy soil; soil management; soil property; sorption; urbanization; water quality; acidity; aquatic environment; Article; cluster analysis; colorimetry; controlled study; density; ecosystem; electric conductivity; environmental management; isotherm; percentage of REM sleep; pH; pollution; porosity; precipitation; principal component analysis; residential area; Rio Grande do Norte; riparian ecosystem; sandy soil; soil; soil analysis; soil property; soil quality; solid waste management; spectrophotometry; tropic climate; urban area; urbanization; vegetation; water insecurity; water quality; water supply; watershed; chemistry; ecosystem; sand; soil; soil pollutant; urbanization; Soils","K.P.V.D.

Currently, Russia and Ukraine are responsible for exporting approximately 25% of the world’s wheat, making any issues in these regions a cause for concern regarding global wheat supply. The problems faced in these areas have led to a surge in wheat prices worldwide. Consequently, it becomes necessary to explore alternative regions that can compensate for the decline in wheat production and supply. This study focuses on wheat production and yield in major producing countries, utilizing the GYGA (Global Yield Gap Atlas) protocol for predictions. The findings reveal a global wheat production gap of 270,378,793 tons. Notably, the largest gap in irrigated wheat production exists in countries like China, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Azerbaijan. Additionally, the rainfed wheat production gap on a global scale amounts to 545,215,692 tons, with Russia, the USA, Kazakhstan, Australia, Ukraine, China, Turkey, Canada, India, and France having the most significant production gaps. Through boundary line analysis, specific criteria were identified for suitable areas of irrigated and rainfed wheat cultivation. For irrigated conditions, the temperature range of 3000 to 7000 GDD (Growing Degree Days) and a temperature seasonality of 3 were determined as favorable. Under rainfed conditions, the suitable areas encompass a temperature range of 2000 to 4000 GDD, an aridity index exceeding 600, and a temperature seasonality of 2. Thirteen countries possess extensive agricultural land within the climatic codes favorable for irrigated wheat cultivation. Approximately 50% of the agricultural lands within these countries, corresponding to the total arable area for irrigated wheat, fall within the climatic codes 3403, 5403, 5303, 4303, 5503, 5203, 3503, 3303, and 4103. China, the United States, Ukraine, Russia, and Iran are the top five countries with favorable lands for irrigated wheat cultivation. Similarly, fourteen countries have significant agricultural lands within the favorable climatic codes for rainfed wheat cultivation. Around 52% of the agricultural lands within these countries are within the climatic codes 3702, 2702, 2802, and 4602. France, Germany, Britain, Poland, and Denmark possess the highest potential to expand rainfed wheat cultivation areas within these favorable climate codes, with respective areas of 2.7, 2.6, 1.6, and 0.9 million hectares. According to the study, the North China Plain emerges as a primary region for increasing irrigated wheat production, both in terms of cultivated area and yield potential. For rainfed conditions, the European continent stands out as a significant region to enhance wheat production. © 2023 Dadrasi et al.

This calls for sustainable practises that enable environment-friendly production while generating sufficient output, as farmers and consumers worldwide depend on adequate yields. Agroforestry can offer solutions to both of these pressing concerns—food insecurity and adverse environmental impacts of intensive maize cultivation. This meta-analysis investigated the effects of agroforestry on maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield under different environmental and management regimes on a global scale. It is based on 1,215 pairwise data entries from 95 peer-reviewed studies. Overall, agroforestry increased median maize yields by 0.24 Mg ha−1 (7%) compared to tree/hedgerow-free maize monocultures. In subtropical and tropical regions, the median yield increment under agroforestry was 0.30 Mg ha−1 (+16%), and the best results were achieved using broadleaved trees (+0.42 Mg ha−1, +53%), especially N-fixing tree species (+0.56 Mg ha−1, +60%). Maize yields responded very well to the addition of tree prunings to the soil of the maize crop (+0.48 Mg ha−1, +24%). Rotating maize with other crops was beneficial if the intermediate crop is able to fix atmospheric N (+0.28 Mg ha−1, +13%). We found that hedgerow planting densities of at least 5,000 woody perennials ha−1 are required for the positive impacts of agroforestry on maize yields to take effect, and these effects increased with both tree age (+1.17 Mg ha−1, +48% under trees 11–15 years of age) and time under agroforestry (+0.85 Mg ha−1, 81% in response to >15 continuous maize seasons under agroforestry). In addition, they were particularly pronounced on sandy soils (+0.46 Mg ha−1, +23%), moderately acidic soils of pH 5–6 (+0.67 Mg ha−1, +35%), soils with <0.5 g kg−1 N (+1.19 Mg ha−1, +81%), soils with a plant-available water holding capacity <10 mm dm−1 (+1.10 Mg ha−1, +44%), and hyper-arid conditions (+0.60 Mg ha−1, +35%). These findings prove that if designed with due regard for local conditions and crop/tree species characteristics, agroforestry can be a powerful tool to increase food security and the sustainability of maize production systems.

Objective: To describe changes in practice and challenges and areas of need related to addressing food insecurity during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic for registered dietitian nutritionist survey respondents. Design: A cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey distributed via the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics e-mail communication platform and social media accounts from April through May 2020 (Wave 1 [W1]) and December 2020-February 2021 (Wave 2 [W2]). Participants and setting: Participants were US-based registered dietitian nutritionists practicing in community-based settings to address food insecurity (W1: n = 454; W2: n = 331). Statistical analyses: Responses were descriptively summarized using means ± SD, medians and interquartile ranges, or number of observations and percentages. Open-ended responses were manually reviewed and organized into major themes. Results: Respondents had about 10 years of experience in addressing food insecurity and were most commonly involved with the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, federal school nutrition programs, or food banks. Participants described increased demand for food security assistance (W1: 68%; W2: 60%). Among respondents involved in food preparation and handling (W1: n = 183; W2: n = 110), supply chain (W1: 61%; W2: 56%) and staffing (W1: 37%; W2: 50%) challenges were commonly reported. Child nutrition program professionals (W1: n = 143; W2: n = 84) reported widespread implementation of optional program waivers, with the most commonly implemented waivers allowing noncongregate meal service (W1: 83%; W2: 81%), caregivers to pick up meals (W1: 69%; W2: 85%), and flexibility in mealservice times (W1: 75%; W2: 87%). Conclusions: Respondents quickly adapted programs to ensure staff and client safety while continuing to provide essential food security services. They identified the need for ongoing nutrition program policy advocacy and timely access to best practice resources during public health emergencies. © 2024 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","","Child; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Assistance; Food Insecurity; Humans; Infant; Meals; Nutritionists; Pandemics; child; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; dietitian; female; food assistance; food insecurity; human; infant; meal; pandemic","K.

Objective: This study aims to describe the protocol of a family-based WhatsApp intervention, specifically designed to investigate the efficacy of multimedia messaging in preventing excessive weight gain and improving healthy eating practices among school-aged children in the Amazon region. Methods: This study protocol outlines a theory-driven randomized controlled trial based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and the social cognitive theory. A total of 240 parents or caregivers of children enrolled in the Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition Cohort Study in Acre (MINA-Brazil) will be recruited by phone and social media. The intervention group will receive persuasive multimedia messages through WhatsApp over 19 weeks, while the waitlist control group will remain in the usual care. The primary outcome is a change in children’s BMI in z score. Secondary outcomes are changes in dietary intake and biochemical indicators of the children. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and 5 months after randomization in comparison to usual care. The analysis will use an intent-to-treat approach and will be conducted using the statistical package Stata (version 18.0), with a significance level set at P<.05. Paired and unpaired 2-tailed t tests will be applied to compare mean changes in the outcomes. Results: Data collection started in June 2023, and final measurements are scheduled to be completed in December 2023. The results of the main analysis are expected to be available in 2024. Conclusions: This innovative multimedia message intervention holds significant potential for fostering behavioral changes among Amazonian children. © Ana Carolina de Andrade Hovadick, Marly Augusto Cardoso.","Amazon; child health; dietary intake; mHealth; mobile health; multimedia messaging service; WhatsApp","","M.A. Cardoso; Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Dr. Arnaldo Avenue, 715 - Cerqueira César, 01246-904, Brazil; email: marlyac@usp.br","","JMIR Publications Inc.","19290748","","","","English","JMIR Res.

Oryzae (Xoo) is a serious disease of rice worldwide that can reduce crop yield and affect food insecurity. A rice resistance variety is an alternate way to solve this problem. The broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) of ULR207 is important for durable resistance to several of the Xoo isolates. However, the inheritance of this resistance gene in ULR207 must be known before it can be utilized. Thus, this study aimed to survey the BB resistance gene with reference to the BB resistance gene for identification of non-analogous or analogous genes and confirmation of a broad-spectrum resistance, to investigate the gene effect, the number of genes, and the heritability of the BB resistance gene in the ULR207 variety. Six populations of two crosses (Maled Phai × ULR207 and RD6 × ULR207), i.e., ULR207 (Donor parent), Maled Phai and RD6 (Recurrent parent), F1, F2, BC1P1, and BC1P2 were constructed. These materials were evaluated for BB resistance by clipping methods under greenhouse conditions using a virulence isolate of a pathogen in Thailand. The results showed that ULR207 exhibited the strongest against BB with 0.8 of BSR with low area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Molecular screening for surveying of the BB resistance gene in ULR207 revealed a non-analogous resistance gene with resistance check varieties. The phenotype of the disease lesion length of F2 and BC1P2 populations exhibited a ratio of 1:3 and 1:1 (resistant: susceptible), respectively, revealing a single recessive gene in both crosses. The scaling test parameters A, B, and C were non-significant (p < 0.01), indicating that variation in data was sufficiently explained by additive (d) and dominance (h) components. The gene action of ULR207 was controlled by additive gene action. Heritability of the two crosses, Maled Phai x ULR207 and RD6 x ULR207, exhibited high values with 0.817 and 0.716, whereas the numbers of the genes were 1.4 and 1.2, respectively. The result indicated that the breeding strategy could be employed in early generations when using ULR207 as a new source of bacterial blight resistance. © 2024 by the authors.","clipping method; gene action; generation mean analysis; heritability; recessive gene","","J.

However, the PCF has not been able to achieve its intended impact. We aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to achieving the PCF implementation outcomes across the RE-AIM dimensions (Reach, Effectiveness or Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This comparative case study analysis selected five contrasting municipalities based on population size, region of the country, implementation model, and length of time implementing the PCF. We conducted 244 interviews with PCF municipal team (municipal managers, supervisors, home visitors), families, and cross-sectoral professionals. A rapid qualitative analysis was used to identify themes across RE-AIM dimensions. Findings: Families’ limited knowledge and trust in PCF goals were a barrier to its reach. While the perceived benefit of PCF on parenting skills and ECD enabled reach, the lack of referral protocols to address social needs, such as connecting food-insecure families to food resources, undermined effectiveness. Questions about whether the social assistance sector should be in charge of PCF challenged its adoption. Implementation barriers exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic included low salaries, temporary contracts, high turnover, infrequent supervision, lack of an effective monitoring system, and nonexistence or non-functioning multisectoral committees. The absence of institutionalized funding was a challenge for sustainability. Interpretation: Complex intertwined system-level barriers may explain the unsuccessful implementation of PCF. These barriers must be addressed for Brazil to benefit from the enormous reach of the PCF and the evidence-based nurturing care principles it is based upon.

A whopping 25% rise in population will see planet Earth host close to ten billion people. This will cause a spectacular increase in the number of mouths to feed; hence providing insights that sustainable management of our resources is a prerequisite. Soil is the core of the resources that man must preserve and conserve. Directly, it is a base factor for agricultural prosperity and increased productivity, while indirectly, human and animal health are impacted by deteriorated soil health. The interventions adopted to improve soil fertility to match the raising numbers of people such as intensification by smallholder farmers and large-scale players through green revolution have caused unacceptable levels of soil degradation leading to infertility. Common to observe in the different environments are chunks of wasteland, yet formerly, these areas served as national, regional or international food baskets and salad bowls. To cushion against the looming predictions of human disaster caused by hunger and intense food insecurity, novel interventions capable of promoting sustainable livelihoods via agricultural production and biofertilizers inclusive, have been tested and proven. Biofertilizers are beneficial microorganisms packaged in a carrier medium which is applied in the soil to introduce and supplement limiting essential nutrients, remediate polluted soil, suppress pathogens and scavenge and chelate heavy metals, among others. The actions of the biofertilizers may involve a single package, dual or consortium. In this chapter, an appraisal is made of biofertilizer use for restoration of fertility in degraded soil environs.

The analysis explores how escalating conflicts post-2015 has undermined global efforts toward ending hunger and ensuring food security by 2030. Method: The research employs a qualitative approach, analyzing data on global armed conflicts and food insecurity rates from 2015 to 2023. It particularly focuses on the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War and its implications for global food supply chains. The study integrates reports from the United Nations, various NGOs, and other authoritative sources to assess the broader impacts of armed conflicts on food security. Results: Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the number of armed conflicts has significantly increased, correlating with heightened global food insecurity. Specifically, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has directly resulted in 1.7 billion people experiencing hunger and 276 million facing severe food insecurity worldwide. This conflict has disrupted agricultural production and global food supply chains, exacerbating the food crisis. Contribution: The findings highlight the severe challenges that armed conflicts pose to achieving global food security. With less than a decade remaining until the 2030 deadline, it is imperative to intensify diplomatic efforts to mitigate conflicts, thereby safeguarding progress toward Zero Hunger. The study underscores the necessity of integrating peace-building strategies into the broader framework of sustainable development. © 2024, Editora Alumni In.

Food insecurity among college students is one of the research topics that is attracting attention worldwide, and interest in this topic is growing by the day. Food insecurity has a negative impact on students' biological, mental and social health. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of food insecurity and correlate it with frequency of food consumption and some variables among undergraduate students. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted with 1149 university students at Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey. The demographic characteristics of the individuals (gender, age, living situation, income status, and health information), anthropometric measurements (body weight and height), nutritional habits, frequency of food consumption, and Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) were questioned. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used for statistical analyses. Results: It was found that 13.1% of the students have mild, 13.0% moderate, and 9.4% severe food insecurity. The rate of individuals with and without food security differs according to gender, living situation, and income status (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant correlations between the food insecurity score and age (p = 0.047), the number of main meals (p < 0.001) and snacks (0.007), and consumption frequency of certain foods (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The prevalance of students facing food insecurity was high. Individuals with food insecurity have a lower frequency of healthy food consumption than individuals with food security.

The purpose of the systematic review was to consolidate evidence for the effect of Covid-19 on students' dietary quality, dietary habits, body weight and food security status. A comprehensive literature search was conducted utilising various databases including Google Scholar, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Embase and Scopus to identify relevant studies. To be incorporated in this review, studies had to include higher education students, measure the prevalence of food insecurity and assess the dietary and body weight changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The studies showed that the diet quality of college students was compromised during the pandemic in many nations due to the decrease in the intake of whole grains, dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits and vegetables and the increase in consumption of alcohol, confectionery products and refined grains. There was an increase in the frequency of cooking, binge eating, breakfast skipping and unhealthy snacking. These modifications, in return, were associated with body weight changes, with no less than 20 to 30 % of students gaining weight during the pandemic. The pandemic also impacted food security status of students, with over 30% being food insecure worldwide. The COVID-19 outbreak has exacerbated the students' diet quality and dietary habits and placed them under high risk of weight gain and food insecurity. Higher education institutions and governments should improve students' access to nutritious foods and incorporate nutrition education interventions in the curricula.  © The Author(s), 2022.

Objective: This study aims to explore the potential use of NLP tools to gather insights from real-world social media data on the public health issue of food security. Methods: A search strategy for obtaining tweets was developed using food security terms. Tweets were collected using the Twitter application programming interface from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021, filtered for Australia-based users only. Sentiment analysis of the tweets was performed using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner. Topic modeling exploring the content of tweets was conducted using latent Dirichlet allocation with BigML (BigML, Inc). Sentiment, topic, and engagement (the sum of likes, retweets, quotations, and replies) were compared across years. Results: In total, 38,070 tweets were collected from 14,880 Twitter users. Overall, the sentiment when discussing food security was positive, although this varied across the 3 years. Positive sentiment remained higher during the COVID-19 lockdown periods in Australia. The topic model contained 10 topics (in order from highest to lowest probability in the data set): “Global production,” “Food insecurity and health,” “Use of food banks,” “Giving to food banks,” “Family poverty,” “Food relief provision,” “Global food insecurity,” “Climate change,” “Australian food insecurity,” and “Human rights.” The topic “Giving to food banks,” which focused on support and donation, had the highest proportion of positive sentiment, and “Global food insecurity,” which covered food insecurity prevalence worldwide, had the highest proportion of negative sentiment. When compared with news, there were some events, such as COVID-19 support payment introduction and bushfires across Australia, that were associated with high periods of positive or negative sentiment. Topics related to food insecurity prevalence, poverty, and food relief in Australia were not consistently more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. Negative tweets received substantially higher engagement across 2019 and 2020. There was no clear relationship between topics that were more likely to be positive or negative and have higher or lower engagement, indicating that the identified topics are discrete issues. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated the potential use of sentiment analysis and topic modeling to explore evolution in conversations on food security using social media data. Future use of NLP in food security requires the context of and interpretation by public health experts and the use of broader data sets, with the potential to track dimensions or events related to food security to inform evidence-based decision-making in this area. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

Fear, job insecurity, changes in their financial stability, concerns about their future lives have changed the entire lives of people and have affected the cognitive well-being of individuals. The purpose of the present analysis is to measure how the COVID-19 pandemic, along with financial factors, has affected the perceived level of well-being of individuals. We are also interested whether there are differences between life before COVID-19, life now with COVID-19, and life after the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of future expectations. To address this objective, we performed an ANOVA approach and a GLM estimate on repeated measures for a large sample (1572 respondents) from 43 worldwide countries, during the period May 2020 and July 2021. Our results show that financial factors reflected by both the size of income and changes in personal or family income affect the levels of happiness. Robustness checks using stress as an alternative estimator for happiness have consolidated our results. Additionally, we find that well-being during COVID-19 compared to the previous period decreased, while in future, people expect to be happier, but not more than in the past when they did not know about the existence of this virus. This is one of the first studies to investigate the relationship between happiness and income before, during, and after COVID-19. These findings are important for policymakers to improve the conditions of living in the areas of health and financial stability. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Financial stability; Happiness; Well-being","COVID-19; Happiness; Humans; Pandemics; adult; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; family income; female; financial crisis; happiness; human; major clinical study; male; pandemic; physiological stress; wellbeing","M.V.

Objective: This article aims to familiarize physicians with the evaluation, management, and prevention of childhood. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted in May, 2021, in Clinical Queries using the key terms ""obesity"" OR “obese”. The search included clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, meta-analyses, observational studies, clinical guidelines, case reports, case series, and reviews. The search was restricted to English literature and children. The information re-trieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. Results: Most obese children have exogenous obesity characterized by a growth rate for height above the 50th percentile, normal intelligence, normal genitalia, and lack of historical or physical evidence of an endocrine abnormality or a congenital syndrome. Obese children are at risk for dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, psychosocial disturbances, impaired quality of life, and shorter life expectancy. The multi-tude of serious comorbidities necessitates effective treatment modalities. Dietary modification, therapeutic exercise, and behavioral modification are the fundamentals of treatment. Pharmacotherapy and/or bariatric surgery should be considered for obese individuals who do not respond to the above measures and suffer from a serious comorbid condition. Conclusion: Childhood obesity, once established, is often refractory to treatment. Most treatment programs lead to a brief period of weight loss, followed by rapid re-accumulation of the lost weight after the termination of therapy. As such, preventive activity is the key to solving the problem of childhood obesity. Childhood obesity can be prevented by promoting a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and lifestyle modification. Parents should be encouraged to get involved in school and community programs that improve their children's nutritional status and physical activity. © 2024 Bentham Science Publishers.","Diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; hypertension; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; obesity; obstructive sleep apnea; overweight","Bariatric Surgery; Child; Exercise; Humans; Life Style; Pediatric Obesity; Quality of Life; adopted child; anthropometry; bariatric surgery; body composition; body mass; body weight loss; caloric intake; childhood; childhood obesity; community program; comorbidity; daily life activity; diabetes mellitus; dietary intake; endocrine disease; energy expenditure; epicardial fat; exercise; fat mass; follow up; food insecurity; food intake; genital system; glycemic index; health care personnel; healthy diet; human; hypertension; insulin sensitivity; intelligence; kinesiotherapy; lean tissue; life expectancy; lifestyle modification; meta analysis; mouth breathing; mouth hygiene; muscle mass; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nutritional status; obstructive sleep apnea; oxidative stress; prevalence; problem solving; public health; review; Review; risk factor; systematic review; thermogenesis; waist circumference; bariatric surgery; child; childhood obesity; lifestyle; quality of life","A.K.C.

They have become the primary medium of human interaction, and smartphone addiction, consequently, has become a modern-day reality. Recent research on smartphone addiction has provided diverse explanations regarding the correlation between gender and addiction. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the correlation and variance among smartphone addiction, gender and interpersonal attachment. Methods: The participants included Taiwanese citizens and the questionnaires were randomly distributed; 1190 valid questionnaires (534 males, 656 females) were collected. Descriptive statistics were computed to observe the average value and standard deviation between interpersonal attachment and gender. Next, Spearman's ρ was conducted to interpret the correlation among smartphone addiction, gender and interpersonal attachment. Finally, the participants were divided into three groups based on their pre-determined level of smartphone addiction: high, moderate and low addictions. The Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed based on interpersonal attachment as the independent variable to determine any statistically significant difference among the three levels. Results: There are four patterns of interpersonal attachment: secure, avoidant, dismissing and anxious attachments. The correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between interpersonal attachment and smartphone addiction (p > 0.000), while revealing no relationship between gender and smartphone addiction or gender and interpersonal attachment. Additionally, the ANOVA indicated the difference was statistically significant in the groups of high and moderate addictions; no statistical significance was identified in the group of low addiction (p < 0.204). Conclusion: This study revealed that there was no correlation between gender and smartphone addiction, but rather, a positive correlation between smartphone addiction and interpersonal attachment. This positive correlation suggests both high and moderate addiction groups display insecurity in their interpersonal attachment. Therefore, to lower the prevalence of unhealthy smartphone addiction, maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships is suggested. © The Author(s) 2023.","anxious; avoidant; dismissing; interpersonal attachment; secure; Smartphone addiction","","Y.-Y.

Forecasts of prevalence that afford sufficient reliability, precision, and advance warning are valuable to facilitate anticipatory action capable of mitigating the extent and downsides of crises. Existing research and resources lack prediction based on statistical analysis with broad cross-national scope and a focus on identifying leading indicators. We model the prevalence of child acute malnutrition at the level of subnational geographic regions (generally first-order administrative divisions), highlighting environmental conditions (precipitation, temperature, vegetation) and lethal and non-lethal conflict activity as main predictors, alongside demographic and geographic characteristics, and involving a temporal vantage point framework that reflects requirements of practical application. Estimations are performed using the random forest machine-learning algorithm, trained on data from 36 countries across mainland Sub-Saharan Africa spanning 2003–2019, including a novel compilation of measurements of prevalence rates drawn from DHS, MICS, and SMART surveys. Our results show strong predictive performance that remains consistent with lead times extending out from one month to 12 months. All the environmental and conflict factors register as important leading indicators. The findings reinforce the potential of relying on model-based approaches to bolster the foundations for humanitarian measures that are better positioned to reduce negative repercussions of food insecurity. © 2023 The Authors","Acute malnutrition; Conflict; Environment; Leading indicators; Predictive modeling and forecasting; Sub-Saharan Africa","Sub-Saharan Africa; child health; environmental conditions; forecasting method; malnutrition; modeling","D.

Two-thirds of PLWHA reside in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where rates of viral load suppression are often suboptimal and frequently attributed to low ART adherence. Strong pill-taking habits are often reported as a key strategy among those who successfully maintain medication adherence, yet not enough is known about the barriers and facilitators in SSA to pill-taking in response to the same contextual cue, which is a necessary step in the habit formation process. Objective: To address this knowledge gap and to inform a subsequent intervention to promote context-dependent repetition, called anchoring, we used a formative qualitative approach to collect in-depth narratives about barriers and facilitators of the anchoring intervention for establishing ART pill-taking habits at the Mildmay Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: We conducted interviews with 25 randomly selected patients starting ART, 5 expert patients, and 10 providers at Mildmay, and performed a rapid analysis to inform the intervention in a timely manner. Results: We found that pill taking in response to the same contextual cue, or anchor, was threatened by stigma and food insecurity and that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these barriers. We also determined that important linguistic changes were needed to the instructional materials and reminder messages in the subsequent intervention to avoid words and phrases with negative connotations for this target population. Conclusions: Several important barriers and facilitators to context-dependent pill taking in Uganda were identified through our formative research that helped to inform important revisions to our subsequent intervention. These findings underscore the importance of understanding local barriers and facilitators when designing and planning interventions, particularly when implementing theory-based intervention approaches that have yet to be tested in a new setting. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Antiretroviral therapy; Behavioral economics; Habit formation; HIV/AIDS; Medication adherence; Sub-saharan africa; Treatment initiators; Uganda","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Africa South of the Sahara; Anti-Retroviral Agents; COVID-19; Habits; HIV Infections; Humans; Medication Adherence; Pandemics; Uganda; Kampala; Uganda; antiretrovirus agent; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; disease treatment; hospital sector; human immunodeficiency virus; qualitative analysis; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; behavioral economics; coronavirus disease 2019; electronic health record; female; food insecurity; habit; health care personnel; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; interpersonal communication; male; pandemic; patient compliance; qualitative research; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Africa south of the Sahara; habit; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; medication compliance; Uganda","A.I.

A growing body of literature explores pathways to food and nutrition security among small-scale farmers but has yet to reach consensus on the most effective pathways (e.g., crop specialization for market sale versus on-farm crop diversification for home consumption) to improve livelihoods. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) based on data drawn from the 2015/16 Uganda National Panel Survey, this study considers how farm and household characteristics including gender, age, education, farm size, region, and off-farm income relate to market engagement (farm sales, market purchases) and on-farm crop diversity (Simpson’s diversity). We then further examine how market engagement and on-farm crop diversity relate to household livelihood outcomes including dietary diversity and food security (number of food secure months). Findings suggest that both higher levels of market engagement and on-farm crop diversity are associated with increased dietary diversity. Higher levels of crop diversity—whether for market sale or for self-consumption—are strongly associated with improved food security. Market engagement is positively associated with increased dietary diversity, and this association is particularly strong for market purchases. Together, these findings highlight the potential for both market-based strategies and on-farm crop diversity to contribute to food security goals in Uganda, providing further evidence that these strategies can be complementary. © 2023, The Author(s).","Crop diversity; Dietary diversity; Food security; Market access; Uganda","Uganda; artificial diet; food consumption; food market; food security; livelihood; market conditions; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach","K.

South Africa is renowned worldwide for its rich biodiversity and a vast body of traditional knowledge among those who consume forest foods. However, despite ecological diversity, frequent barriers remain to getting diversified household diets. This study sought to investigate the contribution of trees and green spaces to household food security in eThekwini. A total of 280 households met the inclusion criteria and consented to participate in this study by responding to questionnaires. The collected data were analysed using descriptive statistics, the computation of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), and the Instrumental Variable Poisson model. The study’s results revealed that only 29% of the respondents were food secure, 36% were mildly food insecure, 27% were moderately food insecure, and 8% were severely food insecure. The Instrumental Variable Poisson model results revealed that cultivated green spaces, wealth index, gender, education level of the head of households, and grants had a negative correlation with household food insecurity. On the other hand, non-cultivated green spaces, local trees, age, marital status, number of dependents, and monthly income positively correlated with food insecurity. Given the existence of trees and green spaces in eThekwini, there is potential for food security solutions to be formed around both cultivated and uncultivated green spaces to promote sustainable access to food and nutritious diets in low-income households. Policy interventions should adopt an approach that encourages the incorporation of foods from both cultivated and uncultivated trees and green spaces in people’s diets. © 2023 by the authors.

Adolescents are a particularly vulnerable group to food insecurity, as they enter adulthood with less parental supervision and greater personal autonomy, but less legislative or institutional protection. The experience of food insecurity in adolescents is influenced by several environmental factors at different levels (interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal), although they are not usually addressed in the design of interventions, prioritizing the individual behavioural factors. We present a scoping review protocol for assessing and identifying the environmental factors that could influence adolescents' food insecurity. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and the PRISMA guidelines for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) to prepare the protocol. The search strategy will be performed in the following databases: Pubmed/Medline, EMBASE, Biblioteca Virtual de Salud, EBSCOHost, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library Plus. The reference list of the included studies will also be hand-searched. Grey literature will be search through the electronic database Grey Literature Report, and local, provincial, national, and international organisations' websites. Assessment of eligibility after screening of titles, abstract and full text, and the resolution of discrepancies will be performed by three independent reviewers. This scoping review will contribute to refine the ""logic model of the problem""which constitutes the first step in the intervention mapping protocol. The ""logic model of the problem""from the intervention mapping protocol will serve to classify and analyse the environmental factors. The findings from this review will be presented to relevant stakeholders that have a role in shaping the environmental factors.  © 2023 Capitán-Moyano et al.

Wholesale markets have been understudied in food environments from a Systems Dynamics (SD) perspective. The present research aims to explore how the Great Wholesale Market of Lima (GWML), the principal wholesale market in Peru, affects the accessibility and availability of the potato value chain in Lima. We use the SD approach to understand the role of the wholesale market by identifying dynamics and the major system archetypes. The results show that investment in knowledge and proper tools could decrease costs, reduce waste and increase productivity, growing food accessibility and sales. We argue that this may lay the foundation for a future modeling study where systems and technology improvements in the wholesale market may be tested.  © 2023 PICMET (Portland International Center for Management of Engineering and Technology(.","","Commerce; Investments; Critical problems; Dynamics analysis; Food insecurity; Future models; Modelling studies; System Dynamics; System dynamics approach; System improvements; Value chains; Wholesale markets; Supply chains","","Kocaoglu D.F.; Anderson T.R.; Kozanoglu D.C.; Niwa K.; Steenhuis H.-J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-189084343-4","","","English","PICMET - Portland Int.

This period also was marked by the emergence or large outbreaks of multiple infectious diseases (e.g., Zika virus, yellow fever, and COVID-19). Over time, the growing ease and increased frequency of travel has resulted in the unprecedented global spread of infectious diseases. Detecting infectious diseases and other diagnoses among travelers can serve as sentinel surveillance for new or emerging pathogens and provide information to improve case identification, clinical management, and public health prevention and response. Reporting Period: 2012–2021. Description of System: Established in 1995, the GeoSentinel Network (GeoSentinel), a collaboration between CDC and the International Society of Travel Medicine, is a global, clinical-care–based surveillance and research network of travel and tropical medicine sites that monitors infectious diseases and other adverse health events that affect international travelers. GeoSentinel comprises 71 sites in 29 countries where clinicians diagnose illnesses and collect demographic, clinical, and travel-related information about diseases and illnesses acquired during travel using a standardized report form. Data are collected electronically via a secure CDC database, and daily reports are generated for assistance in detecting sentinel events (i.e., unusual patterns or clusters of disease). GeoSentinel sites collaborate to report disease or population-specific findings through retrospective database analyses and the collection of supplemental data to fill specific knowledge gaps. GeoSentinel also serves as a communications network by using internal notifications, ProMed alerts, and peer-reviewed publications to alert clinicians and public health professionals about global outbreaks and events that might affect travelers. This report summarizes data from 20 U.S. GeoSentinel sites and reports on the detection of three worldwide events that demonstrate GeoSentinel’s notification capability. Results: During 2012–2021, data were collected by all GeoSentinel sites on approximately 200,000 patients who had approximately 244,000 confirmed or probable travel-related diagnoses. Twenty GeoSentinel sites from the United States contributed records during the 10-year surveillance period, submitting data on 18,336 patients, of which 17,389 lived in the United States and were evaluated by a clinician at a U.S. site after travel. Of those patients, 7,530 (43.3%) were recent migrants to the United States, and 9,859 (56.7%) were returning nonmigrant travelers. Among the recent migrants to the United States, the median age was 28.5 years (range = <19 years to 93 years); 47.3% were female, and 6.0% were U.S. citizens. A majority (89.8%) were seen as outpatients, and among 4,672 migrants with information available, 4,148 (88.8%) did not receive pretravel health information. Of 13,986 diagnoses among migrants, the most frequent were vitamin D deficiency (20.2%), Blastocystis (10.9%), and latent tuberculosis (10.3%). Malaria was diagnosed in 54 (<1%) migrants. Of the 26 migrants diagnosed with malaria for whom pretravel information was known, 88.5% did not receive pretravel health information. Before November 16, 2018, patients’ reasons for travel, exposure country, and exposure region were not linked to an individual diagnosis. Thus, results of these data from January 1, 2012, to November 15, 2018 (early period), and from November 16, 2018, to December 31, 2021 (later period), are reported separately. During the early and later periods, the most frequent regions of exposure were Sub-Saharan Africa (22.7% and 26.2%, respectively), the Caribbean (21.3% and 8.4%, respectively), Central America (13.4% and 27.6%, respectively), and South East Asia (13.1% and 16.9%, respectively). Migrants with diagnosed malaria were most frequently exposed in Sub-Saharan Africa (89.3% and 100%, respectively). Among nonmigrant travelers returning to the United States, the median age was 37 years (range = <19 years to 96 years); 55.7% were female, 75.3% were born in the United States, and 89.4% were U.S. citizens. A majority (90.6%) were seen as outpatients, and of 8,967 nonmigrant travelers with available information, 5,878 (65.6%) did not receive pretravel health information. Of 11,987 diagnoses, the most frequent were related to the gastrointestinal system (5,173; 43.2%). The most frequent diagnoses among nonmigrant travelers were acute diarrhea (16.9%), viral syndrome (4.9%), and irritable bowel syndrome (4.1%). Malaria was diagnosed in 421 (3.5%) nonmigrant travelers. During the early (January 1, 2012, to November 15, 2018) and later (November 16, 2018, to December 31, 2021) periods, the most frequent reasons for travel among nonmigrant travelers were tourism (44.8% and 53.6%, respectively), travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFRs) (22.0% and 21.4%, respectively), business (13.4% and 12.3%, respectively), and missionary or humanitarian aid (13.1% and 6.2%, respectively). The most frequent regions of exposure for any diagnosis among nonmigrant travelers during the early and later period were Central America (19.2% and 17.3%, respectively), Sub-Saharan Africa (17.7% and 25.5%, respectively), the Caribbean (13.0% and 10.9%, respectively), and South East Asia (10.4% and 11.2%, respectively). Nonmigrant travelers who had malaria diagnosed were most frequently exposed in Sub-Saharan Africa (88.6% and 95.9% during the early and later period, respectively) and VFRs (70.3% and 57.9%, respectively). Among VFRs with malaria, a majority did not receive pretravel health information (70.2% and 83.3%, respectively) or take malaria chemoprophylaxis (88.3% and 100%, respectively). Interpretation: Among ill U.S. travelers evaluated at U.S. GeoSentinel sites after travel, the majority were nonmigrant travelers who most frequently received a gastrointestinal disease diagnosis, implying that persons from the United States traveling internationally might be exposed to contaminated food and water. Migrants most frequently received diagnoses of conditions such as vitamin D deficiency and latent tuberculosis, which might result from adverse circumstances before and during migration (e.g., malnutrition and food insecurity, limited access to adequate sanitation and hygiene, and crowded housing,). Malaria was diagnosed in both migrants and nonmigrant travelers, and only a limited number reported taking malaria chemoprophylaxis, which might be attributed to both barriers to acquiring pretravel health care (especially for VFRs) and lack of prevention practices (e.g., insect repellant use) during travel. The number of ill travelers evaluated by U.S. GeoSentinel sites after travel decreased in 2020 and 2021 compared with previous years because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions. GeoSentinel detected limited cases of COVID-19 and did not detect any sentinel cases early in the pandemic because of the lack of global diagnostic testing capacity. Public Health Action: The findings in this report describe the scope of health-related conditions that migrants and returning nonmigrant travelers to the United States acquired, illustrating risk for acquiring illnesses during travel. In addition, certain travelers do not seek pretravel health care, even when traveling to areas in which high-risk, preventable diseases are endemic. Health care professionals can aid international travelers by providing evaluations and destination-specific advice. Health care professionals should both foster trust and enhance pretravel prevention messaging for VFRs, a group known to have a higher incidence of serious diseases after travel (e.g., malaria and enteric fever). Health care professionals should continue to advocate for medical care in underserved populations (e.g., VFRs and migrants) to prevent disease progression, reactivation, and potential spread to and within vulnerable populations. Because both travel and infectious diseases evolve, public health professionals should explore ways to enhance the detection of emerging diseases that might not be captured by current surveillance systems that are not site based. © 2023, MMWR Surveillance Summaries.

Individuals in low-income countries/regions are still at individual and community risk concerning inequality, sanitation, and economic conditions. Besides, during the pandemic, the transmission in municipalities and communities in the countryside and less developed regions kept viral spread and required structured and strengthened clinical and laboratory surveillance. Here, we present an observational, analytic, cross-sectional study conducted using secondary data from the Laboratório de Farmacogenômica e Epidemiologia Molecular (LAFEM)-Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC), to evaluate individual and community factors associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection in outpatients from different cities from Southern Region of Bahia State, in Brazil. The data were collected between June 2021 and May 2022. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity by RT-qPCR was correlated with low socio-economic indicators, including the Human development index (HDIc) and Average worker salary (AWSc). Besides, in general, females were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.752; CI 95% 0.663–0.853; p < 0.0001), while brown individuals had more positivity for infection (p < 0.0001). In addition, those who had clinical symptoms were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 6.000; CI 95% 4.932–7.299; p < 0.0001). Although dry cough, headache, and fever were the most frequent, loss of taste (OR = 5.574; CI 95% 4.334–7.186) and loss of smell (OR = 6.327; CI 95% 4.899–8.144) presented higher odds ratio to be positive to SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. Nonetheless, the distribution of these characteristics was not homogenous among the different cities, especially for age and gender. The dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 positivity differed between cities and the total population and reinforces the hypothesis that control strategies for prevention needed to be developed based on both individual and community risk levels to mitigate harm to individuals and the health system. © 2023 by the authors.","community risk; COVID-19; epidemiology; risk factor; SARS-CoV-2; socio-economic status","Brazil; Cities; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; ageusia; anosmia; Article; cardiovascular disease; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cross-sectional study; disease severity; dry cough; fever; food insecurity; geographic distribution; headache; heart rate; human; immune response; nasopharyngeal swab; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; real time polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; sanitation; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smoking; social status; taste; vaccination; Brazil; city; coronavirus disease 2019; female; genetics; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","S.R.

This study aims to assess the mental health of elderly individuals living in a deprived region of Hungary, and to identify and estimate the weight of different determinants of mental health across different age groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted with randomly selected samples of individuals (n = 860) aged 18 years and older in Northeast Hungary. The World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), the single-item Life Satisfaction Scale, and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were used to measure mental health of the participants. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to measure the association between sociodemographic and health-related variables and mental health. Overall, the mean WHO-5 score was 69.2 ± 18.1 and it showed a significant decrease by age (p < 0.001), with the lowest score observed in aged 75 years and above (p < 0.001). The mean life satisfaction score was 7.5 ± 1.9 and it showed a significant decreasing trend over the life course (p < 0.001). The highest level of psychological distress as assessed by GHQ-12 was observed in the group aged 75 years or older (11.5 ± 6.0, p < 0.001). Multiple linear regression indicated that self-reported financial status, social support, sense of control over their health, activity limitation and pain intensity were the most important determinants of mental health among older adults. Interventions to improve the mental health of older adults should focus on the positive impact of social support, the reduction of financial insecurity and the use of effective pain relief medications. © The Author(s) 2024.","Ageing; Elderly; Life satisfaction; Mental well-being; Psychological distress; Social support","","R.

With an onus on the distillery sector to reduce its environmental impact, such as carbon emissions, opportunities for increasing energy efficiency need to be implemented. This study explores the potential environmental benefits and financial gains achievable through heat recovery from different process and by-product streams, exemplified for a Scotch whisky distillery, but transferrable to micro-distilleries worldwide. The eco-efficiency methodology is applied, taking into account both climate change and water scarcity impacts as well as economic performance of alcohol production with and without heat recovery. A Life Cycle Assessment, focusing on climate change and water scarcity, is combined with a financial assessment considering investment costs and the present value of the savings over the 20-year service life of the heat recovery system. The proposed heat recovery systems allow carbon emission reductions of 8–23% and water scarcity savings of 13–55% for energy and water provision for 1 L of pure alcohol (LPA). Financial savings are comparatively smaller, at 5–13%, due to discounting of the future savings – but offer a simple payback of the investment costs in under two years. The eco-efficiency of the distillery operations can be improved through all proposed heat recovery configurations, but best results are obtained when heat is recovered from mashing, distillations and by-products altogether. A sensitivity analysis confirmed that the methodology applied here delivers robust results and can help guide other micro-distilleries on whether to invest in heat recovery systems, and/or the heat recovery configuration. Uptake should be enhanced through increased information and planning support, and in cases where the distillery offers insufficient heat and water sinks to use all pre-warmed water, opportunities to link with a heat sink outside the distillery are encouraged. A 10% reduction in heating fuel use through heat recovery has the potential to save 47 kt of CO2 eq. or £7.4 M per annum in United Kingdom malt whisky production alone, based on current fuel types used and current prices (2021). © 2022 The Authors","Available water remaining (AWARE); Cooling water; Craft distilleries; Greenhouse gas emissions; Net present value; Potable spirits","Carbon; Climate Change; Ethanol; Hot Temperature; Water; United Kingdom; Carbon; Climate change; Cooling water; Costs; Distillation; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Life cycle; Potable water; Sensitivity analysis; Waste heat; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water management; alcohol; carbon; water; Available water; Available water remaining; Craft distillery; Eco-efficiency; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heat recovery systems; Investment costs; Potable spirit; The net present value (NPV); Water scarcity; alcohol; byproduct; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; investment; recycling; savings; alcohol production; Article; carbon emission; carbon footprint; climate change; comparative study; cost control; electricity; energy conservation; energy consumption; energy recovery; environmental impact; evaporation; fluid intake; greenhouse gas emission; investment; life cycle assessment; waste water recycling; water insecurity; whiskey; winery wastewater; heat; Distilleries","I.

Recently, the resurgence of COVID-19 has highlighted the limitations of the world-health surveillance measures and caused unprecedented effects on the food supply chain and the food industry. Amid this recent crisis, aroused population and scientific concerns and the demand for food safety and quality control improvement trough-out the food supply chain. To solve this constraint, it is primordial to understand food supply chain contamination stem and develop new, more sensitive, specific effective, and efficient point-of-care detection methods to segregate food items at an early pathogen contamination stage. 3D printing technology positioned itself as the solution because it enables the synergistic action of new molecular detection methods combined with the new 3D printing techniques for the production of high end-point biosensors capable of direct testing of food along the production line and the food supply chain. Because 3D printed biosensors are user and eco-friendly, convenient, fast, and take away the laboratory analysis constraints, 3D printed molecular biosensor devices are the new trend to enhance the food safety screening performances and guarantee food quality.

A lack of access to food may explain the association of food insecurity (FI) with both undernutrition and obesity, but there are other factors that are specifically related to obesity. Studies have also found that FI is related to both overweight and obesity among women but not among men. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between FI and weight status among adults from a nationally representative sample of Brazil and to consider the impacts of sex. Data from the 2017-2018 Household Budget Survey (n 28 112), a national cross-sectional study, were analysed using the Brazilian Household FI Scale (EBIA) and BMI (measured in kg/m2) by individual self-reported weight and height. Associations were estimated by OR with 95 % CI considering a multinomial logistic regression model. Women with severe FI were more than twice (OR = 2·36) as likely to be underweight and had a higher frequency of obesity (OR = 1·39). Among men, severe FI status was a protective factor for overweight (OR = 0·58) and obesity (OR = 0·61). In conclusion, FI was a risk factor for underweight and obesity among women but not among men. © The Author(s), 2022.

No study has yet explored the structural characteristics and drivers of the evolution of global virtual water trade networks from a network structure evolution perspective. This paper aims to fill this critical gap by developing a research framework to explore how endogenous network structures and external factors have influenced the evolution of virtual water trade networks. We constructed virtual water trade networks for 62 countries worldwide from 2000 to 2015 and used an innovative combination of multi-regional input–output data and stochastic actor-oriented models for analytical purposes. Our results support the theoretical hypothesis of ecologically unequal exchange and trade drivers, arguing that virtual water flows from less developed countries to developed countries under global free trade and that unequal trade patterns lead to excessive consumption of virtual water in less developed countries. The results partially support the theoretical content of water endowment and traditional gravity models, finding that trade networks are expanding to farther and larger markets, confirming that national water scarcity levels do not impact the evolution of virtual water trade networks. Finally, we point out that meritocratic links, path dependence, reciprocity, and transmissive links have extreme explanatory power for the evolutionary development of virtual water networks. © 2023 by the authors.","ecologically unequal exchange; multi-regional input–output table; stochastic actor-oriented model; virtual water trade; water endowment","Agriculture; Internationality; Water; Water Resources; Water Supply; water; globalization; input-output analysis; network analysis; numerical model; stochasticity; sustainability; water economics; Article; controlled study; developed country; developing country; flow measurement; gravity model; human; longitudinal study; stochastic model; theoretical study; trade (economics); water conservation; water flow; water insecurity; water supply; agriculture; international cooperation; procedures","L.

Disruptions stemming from colonization and climate change have led to a decrease in harvesting, resulting in higher rates of food insecurity. The aim of the Niska program was to reconnect Elders and youth to revitalize goose harvesting activities and associated Indigenous knowledge within the community. The program and evaluation were built using a two-eyed seeing (Etuaptmumk) and community-based participatory research approach. Salivary cortisol, a biomedical measure of stress, was collected before (n = 13) and after (n = 13) participation in the spring harvest. Likewise, cortisol samples were collected before (n = 12) and after (n = 12) the summer harvest. Photovoice and semi-directed interviews were employed after the spring (n = 13) and summer (n = 12) harvests to identify key elements of well-being from an Indigenous perspective. The changes observed in cortisol levels for the spring (p = 0.782) and summer (p = 0.395) harvests were not statistically significant. However, there was a noteworthy increase in the subjective well-being observed through the qualitative measures (semi-directed interviews and photovoice), highlighting the importance of using multiple perspectives when assessing well-being, especially in Indigenous peoples. Future programs should incorporate multiple perspectives when addressing complex environmental and health issues, such as food security and environmental conservation, especially in Indigenous homelands worldwide. © 2023 by the authors.","cortisol; First Nations; food security; goose harvesting; Indigenous; photovoice; stress; subarctic Canada; two-eyed seeing; well-being; wellness","Adolescent; Aged; Animals; Canada; Geese; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Niska Indians; Ontario; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; colonization; conservation management; food security; harvesting; indigenous population; local participation; qualitative analysis; research work; adult; Article; community care; emotional well-being; environmental protection; First Nation; food security; goose; goose harvesting; harvesting; human; indigenous people; interview; knowledge; nonhuman; Ontario; participatory research; physiological stress; qualitative analysis; spring; summer; wellbeing; adolescent; aged; animal; Canada; Ontario","F.

Individuals experiencing food insecurity are more likely to exhibit poor health-related endpoints. Dental caries, a highly prevalent noncommunicable disease, is modulated by an interplay between biological, behavioral, and environmental factors. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess whether individuals experiencing food insecurity were more likely to exhibit dental caries than individuals facing food security. Data Sources: The Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid, CINAHL, LILACS, and APA PsycINFO databases were checked from inception to November 2021. Grey literature and Google Scholar were also examined. An updated search was conducted in August 2022. Observational studies were included if they evaluated the association between dental caries and food insecurity status. Data Extraction: Data extraction was performed by two reviewers. Data Analysis: Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using R language. In total, 514 references were retrieved from databases, of which 14 articles were included in qualitative synthesis and 7 were merged into meta-analysis. The results of an inverse-variance meta-analysis (OR = 1.62; 95%CI, 1.01-2.60) and a meta-analysis of binary data (OR = 1.66; 95%CI, 1.36-2.02) demonstrated that food-insecure individuals were more likely to exhibit dental caries than food-secure individuals. Inverse-variance meta-analyses appraising multiple strata of food security also showed that individuals experiencing marginal food security (OR = 1.48; 95%CI, 1.28-1.72), individuals experiencing low food security (OR = 1.26; 95%CI, 1.01-1.57), and those experiencing very low food security (OR = 1.33; 95%CI, 1.04-1.71) were more likely to exhibit dental caries than individuals experiencing full food security. Conclusion: Dental caries is associated with food insecurity. Individuals living with food insecurity are more likely to exhibit dental caries than those who have food security.

In North America, the prevalence of food insecurity among PLWH exceeds 50%. In the province of British Columbia (BC), it exceeds 65%. It comes as no surprise that food has become an essential tool in supporting and engaging with PLWH. Over the past decade, however, a shift has taken place, and food has become an incentive to boost uptake and outcomes of prevention, testing, treatment, and support. To explore this practice, we drew on a qualitative case study of incentives in the care and support of PLWH. This paper presents the findings of a targeted analysis of interviews (N = 25) that discuss food incentives and explores two main themes that shed light on this practice: (1) Using food to engage versus to incentivize and (2) Food is more beneficial and more ethical. Providers perceived food more positively than other incentives, despite the goal remaining somewhat the same. Incentives, such as cash or gift cards, were considered ethically problematic and less helpful (and potentially harmful), whereas food addressed a basic need and felt more ethical. © 2021 The Author(s).

Many previous impact evaluations of lockdowns are unreliable because lockdowns co-occurred with severe coronavirus disease related health and financial insecurities. This was not the case in Melbourne’s 111-day lockdown, which left other Australian jurisdictions unaffected. Interrogating nationally representative longitudinal survey data and quasi-experimental variation, and controlling for multiple hypothesis testing, we found that lockdown had some statistically significant, albeit small, impacts on several domains of human life. Women had lower mental health (−0.10 s.d., P = 0.043, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.21 to −0) and working hours (−0.13 s.d., P = 0.006, 95% CI = −0.22 to −0.04) but exercised more often (0.28 s.d., P < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.39) and received more government transfers (0.12 s.d., P = 0.048, 95% CI = 0.001 to 0.24). Men felt less part of their community (−0.20 s.d., P < 0.001, 95% CI = −0.30 to −0.10) and reduced working hours (−0.12 s.d., P = 0.004, 95% CI = −0.20 to −0.04). Heterogeneity analyses demonstrated that families with children were driving the negative results. Mothers had lower mental health (−0.27 s.d., P = 0.014, 95% CI = −0.48 to −0.06), despite feeling safer (0.26 s.d., P = 0.008, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.46). Fathers increased their alcohol consumption (0.35 s.d., P = 0.002, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.57). Some outcomes worsened with lockdown length for mothers.

Addressing social determinants of health (SDoH) may be the next forefront of reducing the enormous burden of CVD. SDoH can be defined as any social, economic, or environmental factor that influences a health outcome. Comprehensive evidence of the role of SDoH in CVD is lacking, nevertheless. This umbrella review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the role of SDoH in CVD. We searched systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) using 8 databases and included review reference lists. Four themes (economic circumstances, social/community context, early childhood development, and neighbourhood/built environment) and health literacy in the health/health care theme were considered. Seventy reviews were eligible. Despite the quality of the included reviews being low or critically low, there was consistent evidence that factors relating to economic circumstances and early childhood development themes were associated with an increased risk of CVD and CVD mortality. We also found evidence that factors in the social/community context and neighbourhood/built environment themes, such as social isolation, fewer social roles, loneliness, discrimination, ethnicity, neighborhood socioeconomic status, violence, and environmental attributes, had a role in CVD. SDoH factors without (or with minimal) evidence synthesis for CVD were also identified. In sum, this umbrella review offers evidence that SDoH, especially economic circumstance and early childhood development, play a significant role in CVD. This calls for the strengthening of nonmedical interventions that address multiple factors simultaneously and the inclu-sion of SDoH in future CVD risk prediction models. © 2023 The Authors.

Drawing on empirical work situated within an international context, this book presents evidence alongside country specific case studies to provide a global exploration of how women’s insecurity increased during this global health crisis at the same as their access to support services reduced. It provides a timely analysis of the degree to which the pandemic and associated government restrictions impacted on women’s experiences of violence with particular attention to changes in its prevalence and severity, and in system and service responses to women’s help-seeking. In addition, the differential impacts of the pandemic in relation to the experiences of priority cohorts, including violence experienced by children and temporary migrant women is also explored. The key focus is on the nature, extent, and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic on service delivery, accessibility of support, and access to justice for women experiencing domestic and family violence. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2023.

Water inequality, characterized by disparities in access and availability of water resources, has emerged as a critical global challenge with far-reaching social, economic, and environmental implications. Using a globally representative observational streamflow dataset and Gini coefficients, this study investigates how streamflow inequality, which has a large impact on inequality of water availability, varies spatially and temporally, and its relationship with different underlying catchment characteristics. This study finds that watersheds in arid climates exhibit a higher degree of streamflow inequality than polar and equatorial ones. Africa experiences the highest streamflow inequality, followed by Australia, while South America experiences relatively lower streamflow inequality. Around 19.6 % of the catchments in Australia display an increasing trend in streamflow inequality, pointing to worsening conditions. Conversely, South America experiences a decreasing trend in streamflow inequality in 18.3 % of its catchments during the same period. It is also found that a more evenly distributed precipitation within the catchment and higher dam storage capacity corresponds to more evenly distributed streamflow availability throughout the year. This study enhances our understanding of streamflow inequality worldwide, which will aid policy formulation to foster sustainable development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Gini coefficient; Streamflow; Sustainable development; Water; Water scarcity","Australia; Large dataset; Runoff; Stream flow; Sustainable development; water; Australia; Clean waters; Gini coefficients; Global challenges; Human rights; Social-economic; South America; Streamflow; Water scarcity; Waters resources; arid environment; dam; precipitation intensity; resource scarcity; streamflow; sustainable development; trend analysis; water availability; watershed; Article; dam (barrier); sanitation; sustainable development; water availability; water insecurity; Africa; article; Australia; catchment area (hydrology); controlled study; desert climate; Gini coefficient; human; precipitation; South America; water insecurity; water supply; watershed; Catchments","M.

In Brazil, communities of descendants of enslaved blacks (quilombola) have historically had some of the highest rates of vulnerability and poverty, characterized by lack of health assistance, poor quality of life, and nutritional insecurity. Methods: A cross-sectional sampling of quilombola individuals living in four communities of southern Brazil, as well as their dogs and the soil, was carried out from December 2021 to March 2022. Sociodemographic and other information such as water source, alimentary habits, and dog and cat ownership were gathered using a semi-structured questionnaire for assessing toxocariasis risk factors. Human serum samples were tested by ELISA for anti-Toxocara spp. IgG antibody detection was carried out on dog feces and hair, and soil samples were surveyed for presence of Toxocara spp. eggs. Results: Overall, 172/208 individuals (82.7%, 95% CI = 77.0–87.2) were seropositive, the highest seroprevalence rate to date in Brazil. Male gender (P = 0.029), educational level (P = 0.026), and drinking water source (P = 0.043) were associated with seropositivity by univariate analysis. Final logistic regression revealed increased odds (P = 0.017, OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.5–42.7) to have seropositivity in individuals > 50 years old (< 10 years old). As expected, individuals with soil contact were more likely seropositive (P = 0.038, OR = 4.4, 95% CI = 1.1–18.8). Although retrieved in only 5/96 (5.2%) dog feces, Toxocara spp. eggs were found in 18/60 (30.0%) soil samples. Conclusions: The high vulnerability and seroprevalence observed in quilombola communities clearly demand a One Health approach for detection, monitoring, and prevention of infection by Toxocara spp. in both human and dog populations.

Our study meticulously examines the intricate virtual water trade network inside and outside the basin, providing essential insights to combat its acute water scarcity. We calculated water consumption coefficients for seven pivotal sectors across diverse Chinese provinces, forming the foundational data for quantifying virtual water trade both inside and outside the basin. Utilizing the 2015 Multi-Regional Input-Output Table, we assessed the Yellow River Basin's reliance on external water resources. Despite enduring chronic water scarcity, the basin annually exports a substantial 27.2 billion m3 of virtual water, equivalent to half of its yearly runoff. This outflow predominantly flows to the economically advanced eastern coastal region, with Agriculture and Manufacturing sectors dominating. Significantly, an irrational industrial layout leads to a substantial transfer of virtual water from economically disadvantaged areas to more affluent regions, exacerbating water scarcity in the basin's less privileged areas. Our study yields critical insights for mitigating water shortages in the Yellow River Basin and provides a transferrable framework for regions worldwide grappling with analogous challenges. © 2023.

While most investigations into the implications of this era focus on the development of intensive farming in places such as Mexico, India, and the Philippines, few offer critical analysis of its Caribbean manifestations. This paper examines the role of the Green Revolution in the production of environmental injustice in Haiti. Historically, we situate Green Revolution technopolitics in a broader trajectory of US-led imperial and neoliberal interventions that spans from the Occupation of Haiti (1915–1934) to the 21st century. We draw from our long-term ethnographic research to show how Green Revolution transformations impact agrarian life in Haiti's lower Artibonite Valley and Central Plateau today. Integral to the Occupation were efforts to (re)establish production of export commodities. We demonstrate how such attempts, regardless of outcome, generated indelible material, social, and ecological entanglements that served to intensify empire. In 1949, the US and Haitian governments established an agency tasked with extending Occupation-era irrigation infrastructure throughout the Artibonite Valley. After these efforts stalled, 1970s interventionists sought different inroads for increasing agricultural production, particularly of rice. Their initiatives paved the way for post-2010 ventures that perpetuate many of the same consequences, including hunger, economic insecurity, and environmental degradation. We show how the history of imperial intervention in Haiti created the conditions for the ongoing production of environmental injustice through agrarian reform. Ultimately, we argue that the Green Revolution transformed Haiti's agrarian geographies in ways that intensified environmental harms and advanced a project of US empire that continues to shape Haiti today. We examine the contemporary implications of this century of transformation for farmers, who carry on a legacy of agrarian justice that has contested the project of the Green Revolution since its inception.

A crucial window of opportunity for ensuring children's proper growth and development through adequate eating exists during the first two years of life. According to the evidence of the efficacy of interventions, achieving universal coverage of optimal breastfeeding could prevent 13% of deaths in children under the age of 5 worldwide, and using complementary feeding methods appropriately would lead to an additional 6% decrease in under-five mortality. Methods: From several electronic databases, all published, unpublished, and gray literature was extracted and exported into EndNote version X20. For further analysis of the review, the retrieved data from the excel sheet were imported into the statistical software program Stata version. Metanalysis was used to determine the prevalence of MAD, and a random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of MAD. The DerSimonian-Laird Random effects model (REM) was used to combine the determinant factors from all qualifying papers for the meta-analysis, and the heterogeneity was independently assessed using a χ2 test, Q statistics, and matching I2 statistics. To retrieve the extent of publication bias, funnel plots were scattered and tested for asymmetry and, additionally, Egger’s test was computed with the user-written “meta bias” command in Stata (version 11) software. To end, sensitivity analyses with trim and fill were performed. Results: The pooled estimate of the overall prevalence of minimum acceptable diet in 16 studies in Ethiopia was 22% with (95% CI: 16, 28%) with a random effect model. However, eight papers were filled during trim and fill in order to counteract the small study effect. The overall filled pooled estimate was 7.9% with (95%CI: 11, 14.8%). Maternal education (primary and secondary) is 1.714 (95% CI 1.244,2.363) and 2.150(95% CI: 1.449,3.190), respectively, Ages of children with range of 12–17 months (2.158 (95% CI 1. 9,3.006) and 18–23 months 2.948(95% CI: 1.675,5.190)), Nutrition information ((1.883 (95% CI 1.169,3.032)) media exposure (1.778(95% CI: 1.396,2.265), and maternal knowledge (2.449 (95% CI 1.232, 5.027) were significantly associated with MAD. Conclusion: The pooled estimate of the overall prevalence of minimum acceptable diet in 16 studies in Ethiopia were low. Maternal education (primary and secondary), ages of child with range of 12–17 month and 18–23 months, mothers having nutrition information, mothers who have media exposure,and mothers having good knowledge were significantly associated with Minimum acceptable diet. The government, NGO, and other stakeholders should focus on improving Minimum acceptable diet among 6 to 23 months of children through promoting with mass media, focuses on nutrition council during critical contact point in health facility, and doing capacity building for the mothers/caregivers. © The Author(s) 2024.","Dietary diversity; Ethiopia; Meal frequency; Minimum acceptable diet; Systematic review","Breast Feeding; Child; Diet; Ethiopia; Female; Humans; Infant; Mothers; Nutritional Status; Article; breast feeding; breast milk; child; complementary feeding; decision making; diet; food insecurity; food security; human; infancy; mass media exposure; meta analysis; mortality; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; prevalence; quality control; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; education; epidemiology; Ethiopia; female; infant; mother; nutritional status","K.A.

The Horn of Africa, which includes eastern Ethiopia, northeast Kenya, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia, has natural characteristics that favor high groundwater salinity. Excess salinity has been linked to infrastructure and health problems, including increased infant mortality. This region has suffered successive droughts that have limited the availability of safe drinking water resources, leading to a humanitarian crisis for which little spatially explicit information about groundwater salinity is available. Methods: Machine learning (random forest) is used to make spatial predictions of salinity levels at three electrical conductivity (EC) thresholds using data from 8646 boreholes and wells along with environmental predictor variables. Attention is paid to understanding the input data, balancing classes, performing many iterations, specifying cut-off values, employing spatial cross-validation, and identifying spatial uncertainties. Results: Estimates are made for this transboundary region of the population potentially exposed to hazardous salinity levels. The findings indicate that about 11.6 million people (∼7% of the total population), including 400,000 infants and half a million pregnant women, rely on groundwater for drinking and live in areas of high groundwater salinity (EC > 1500 µS/cm). Somalia is the most affected and has the largest number of people potentially exposed. Around 50% of the Somali population (5 million people) may be exposed to unsafe salinity levels in their drinking water. In only five of Somalia's 18 regions are less than 50% of infants potentially exposed to unsafe salinity levels. The main drivers of high salinity include precipitation, groundwater recharge, evaporation, ocean proximity, and fractured rocks. The combined overall accuracy and area under the curve of multiple runs is ∼ 82%. Conclusions: The modelled groundwater salinity maps for three different salinity thresholds in the Horn of Africa highlight the uneven spatial distribution of salinity in the studied countries and the large area affected, which is mainly arid flat lowlands. The results of this study provide the first detailed mapping of groundwater salinity in the region, providing essential information for water and health scientists along with decision-makers to identify and prioritize areas and populations in need of assistance. © 2023 The Author(s)","Djibouti; Drinking water; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Groundwater quality; Human health; Kenya; Machine learning; Random forest; Somalia; Spatial modeling; Water scarcity","Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Ethiopia; Female; Groundwater; Humans; Infant; Pregnancy; Salinity; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Djibouti [East Africa]; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Horn of Africa; Kenya; Somalia; Biodiversity; Forestry; Health risks; Potable water; Risk perception; Water quality; drinking water; ground water; nitrogen; drinking water; Djibouti; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Groundwater quality; Human health; Kenya; Machine-learning; Random forests; Somalia; Spatial modelling; Water scarcity; drinking water; groundwater resource; health care; health impact; health risk; machine learning; public health; salinity; spatial analysis; accuracy; Africa; area under the curve; Article; climate change; concentration (parameter); Djibouti; electric conductivity; environmental temperature; Eritrea; Ethiopia; evaporation; female; high risk population; human; humanitarian crisis; infant; Kenya; particle size; precipitation; predictive model; predictor variable; pregnant woman; random forest; risk assessment; rock; salinity; sea; soil acidity; Somalia; water insecurity; water quality; chemistry; environmental monitoring; pregnancy; procedures; salinity; water pollutant; Machine learning","D.

Chan School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology","Background & Purpose: Adolescent housing insecurity is a dynamic form of social adversity that impacts child health outcomes worldwide. However, the means by which adolescent housing insecurity may become biologically embedded to influence health outcomes over the life course remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to utilize life course perspectives and advanced causal inference methods to evaluate the potential for inflammation to contribute to the biological embedding of adolescent housing insecurity. Materials and methods: Using prospective data from the Great Smoky Mountains Study, we investigated the relationship between adolescent housing insecurity and whole-blood spot samples assayed for C-reactive protein (CRP). Adolescent housing insecurity was created based on annual measures of frequent residential moves, reduced standard of living, forced separation from the home, and foster care. Annual measures of CRP ranged from 0.001 mg/L to 13.6 mg/L (median = 0.427 mg/L) and were log10 transformed to account for positively skewed values. We used g-estimation of structural nested mean models to estimate a series of conditional average causal effects of adolescent housing insecurity on CRP levels from ages 11 to 16 years and interpreted the results within life course frameworks of accumulation, recency, and sensitive periods. Principal Results: Of the 1,334 participants, 427 [44.3 %] were female. Based on the conditional average causal effect, one exposure to adolescent housing insecurity from ages 11 to 16 years led to a 6.4 % (95 % CI = 0.69 – 12.4) increase in later CRP levels. Exposure at 14 years of age led to a 27.9 % increase in CRP levels at age 15 (95 % CI = 6.5 – 53.5). Recent exposures to adolescent housing insecurity (<3 years) suggested stronger associations with CRP levels than distant exposures (>3 years), but limited statistical power prevented causal conclusions regarding recency effects at the risk of a Type II Error. Major Conclusions: These findings highlight inflammation—as indicated by increased CRP levels—as one potential mechanism for the biological embedding of adolescent housing insecurity. The results also suggest that adolescent housing insecurity—particularly recent, repeated, and mid-adolescent exposures—may increase the risk of poor health outcomes and should be considered a key intervention target. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Adolescent housing insecurity; Biological embedding; C-reactive protein; Child adversity; G-estimation of structural nested mean models; Great Smoky Mountains Study; Inflammation; Longitudinal study; Prospective cohort","Adolescent; C-Reactive Protein; Child; Female; Housing; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Prospective Studies; C reactive protein; C reactive protein; adolescent; Article; biological embedding; body mass; child; controlled study; ethnicity; female; health care utilization; household income; housing; housing instability; human; inflammation; life course perspective; major clinical study; mental health service; preschool child; propensity score; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; school child; sensitivity analysis; social adversity; social problem; social status; substance use; time series analysis; turnover rate; housing; male; metabolism; prospective study","H.

Climate crisis has exacerbated water deficit stress and restricts plant’s growth and output by limiting nutrient absorption and raising osmotic strains. Worldwide, Sweet pepper is among the most important vegetable crops due to its medicinal and nutritional benefits. Drought stress poses negative impacts on sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) growth and production. Although, γ aminobutyric acid (GABA) being an endogenous signaling molecule and metabolite has high physio-molecular activity in plant’s cells and could induce tolerance to water stress regimes, but little is known about its influence on sweet pepper development when applied exogenously. The current study sought to comprehend the effects of foliar GABA application on vegetative development, as well as physiological and biochemical constituents of Capsicum annuum L. A Field experiment was carried out during the 2021 pepper growing season and GABA (0, 2, and 4mM) concentrated solutions were sprayed on two Capsicum annuum L. genotypes including Scope F1 and Mercury, under drought stress of 50% and 30% field capacity. Results of the study showed that exogenous GABA supplementation significantly improved vegetative growth attributes such as, shoot and root length, fresh and dry weight, as well as root shoot ratio (RSR), and relative water content (RWC) while decreasing electrolyte leakage (EL). Furthermore, a positive and significant effect on chlorophyll a, b, a/b ratio and total chlorophyll content (TCC), carotenoids content (CC), soluble protein content (SPC), soluble sugars content (SSC), total proline content (TPC), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity was observed. The application of GABA at 2mM yielded the highest values for these variables. In both genotypes, peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) content increased with growing activity of those antioxidant enzymes in treated plants compared to non-treated plants. In comparison with the rest of GABA treatments, 2mM GABA solution had the highest improvement in morphological Copyright: © 2023 Iqbal et al.","","Antioxidants; Capsicum; Chlorophyll A; Crops, Agricultural; Dehydration; Droughts; 4 aminobutyric acid; antioxidant; ascorbate peroxidase; catalase; chlorophyll a; chlorophyll b; proline; superoxide dismutase; Article; Capsicum annuum; climate change; drought stress; electric conductivity; genotype; germination; greenhouse effect; incubation time; nonhuman; physiology; soil analysis; sweet pepper; water insecurity; water stress; crop; dehydration; drought; pepper","B.

Seawater desalination is an appealing adaptation option in regions with access to the coast; however, it has sustainability challenges that require careful consideration. Two critical challenges are: how to manage the spectrum of potential adverse social and environmental impacts; and how to provide fair and sustainable water access benefits to the region as a whole. This paper presents a participatory modelling framework designed to support the participatory planning of sustainable integration of desalinated seawater into a regional water supply network in water-scarce regions. The framework is based on a modelling tool that facilitates collaborative understanding of the regional context and optimises and maps candidate water supply networks and the associated trade-offs between economic, environmental and social performance criteria. The framework aims to facilitate dialogue between all interested parties and contributes to a more informed, fair, consented, long-term and sustainable integration of desalinated seawater into regional water supply schemes. An application to the Atacama region in Chile illustrates the capabilities of the framework to communicate options under varying conditions of environmental protection. The case study also illustrates the role of stakeholders in the process of tool refinement as part of early-stage participatory planning. © 2024 The Authors","Collaborative modelling; Desalination; Integrated water supply systems; Participatory planning; Stakeholder engagement","Atacama; Chile; Chile; ground water; sea water; desalination; economic development; integrated approach; participatory approach; seawater; social development; stakeholder; sustainability; water supply; Article; case study; community; cost benefit analysis; desalination; economic development; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental protection; geographic information system; human; marine environment; model; natural resource; overexploitation; stakeholder engagement; sustainable development; water insecurity; water supply","L.

However, the phenomena of decreasing food production and trade interruptions are becoming increasingly common. Currently, there is a lack of simultaneous research on food production and import trade. This study compiles socio-economic environmental data from 146 countries and regions worldwide and employs mobile window and network analysis methods to illustrate how food production quantity influences the social-ecological system. The research findings indicate that in the majority of regions worldwide (102 countries), food demand is met through the local food supply, with a predominant distribution in coastal and inland areas. However, 31% of countries or regions primarily achieve food security through import trade, and many of them are island nations and peninsular countries. This discovery provides valuable insights for understanding the diversity and dependency within the global food system. Based on the impact of food production quantity on the global socio-ecological system network, this study reveals the uneven strengths of connections between nodes and inconsistent connection directions. Building upon these findings, we propose recommendations concerning agricultural policies, human-environment relationships, agricultural transformation, and climate change to help prevent and manage food insecurity risks. © 2023 by the authors.","food security; global food production; moving windows; network analysis","food market; food production; food security; import; network analysis","H.

China is expected to undergo a shale revolution following the U.S. Most of the information on water footprint of shale gas exploration and hydraulic fracturing has been focused on the U.S. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by establishing a comprehensive database of shale gas extraction in China, utilizing operational data from over 90 % of shale gas wells across the country. We present systematic analysis of water usage and flowback and produced water (FP water) production from all the major shale gas fields in China. Between 2012 and 2022, a total of 2740 shale gas wells were hydraulically fractured in China, primarily located in Sichuan and Chongqing Province. About 113 million m3 water was used for hydraulic fracturing, resulting in a cumulative shale gas production of 116 billion m3. As of 2022, the annual water use for hydraulic fracturing exceeded 20 million m3, and the annual FP water production reached 8.56 million m3. Notably, 80 % ~ 90 % of the FP water has been reused for hydraulic fracturing since 2020, accounting for 29 % to 35 % of the annual water usage for hydraulic fracturing. Water use per well in China varies primarily between 21,730 m3 to 61,070 m3 per well, and water use per horizontal length ranges primarily between 20 m3/m and 35 m3/m. The average ultimate FP water production per well in China was estimated to be 22,460 m3. The water use intensity (WUI) for shale gas extraction in China mainly ranges from 7 to 25.4 L/GJ, which is significantly higher than that of the U.S. This disparity is largely due to the lower Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) of shale gas wells in China. Despite the considerable water consumption during the hydraulic fracturing process, shale gas has a relatively low water footprint compared to other conventional energy resources in China. The Produced water intensity (PWI) for shale gas extraction in China ranges from 3.9 to 7.3 L/GJ, which is consistent with the previously reported PWI values for shale gas extraction in the U.S. This study predicts water usage and FP production spanning the period 2023 to 2050 under two scenarios to assess the potential impact of shale gas extraction on water resources in the Longmaxi shale region in Sichuan Basin. The first scenario assumed a constant drilling rate, while the second assumed a yearly 10 % increase in drilling rate. With an assumed FP water reuse rate of 85 % for hydraulic fracturing, the estimated annual freshwater consumption for the two scenarios is 10.4 million m3 and 163 million m3, respectively. This accounts for only 0.28‱ and 4.4‱ of the total annual surface water resources in Sichuan and Chongqing Province. Our findings suggest that freshwater usage for hydraulic fracturing in humid Southern China is small relative to available surface water resources. However, prospective large-scale shale gas extraction in other arid and semi-arid regions may enhance the regional water scarcity. It is necessary to develop new hydraulic fracturing technologies that can use saline groundwater or other types of marginal water, and explore alternative management and treatment strategies for FP water. © 2023","China; Flowback and produced water; Hydraulic fracturing; Shale gas; Water intensity; Water use","China; Energy resources; Extraction; Fracture; Gas industry; Gases; Horizontal wells; Natural gas well production; Natural gas wells; Petroleum prospecting; Produced Water; Shale gas; Water resources; ground water; natural gas; surface water; China; Flowback; Flowback and produced water; Gas extractions; Gas well; Water footprint; Water intensity; Water production; Water usage; Water use; extraction method; flow field; gas well; hydraulic fracturing; hydrocarbon reservoir; petroleum engineering; semiarid region; shale gas; strategic approach; water footprint; water management; water quality; water resource; water treatment; Article; China; extraction; fracking; gas field; oil shale; waste water recycling; water footprint; water insecurity; Hydraulic fracturing","C.

According to estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 690 million people were undernourished globally in 2019. Malnutrition is no exception in rural cocoa communities in Ghana. The expansion of cocoa is causing food insecurity and low dietary diversity in most cocoa-growing areas. There is little information on the food security status and dietary diversity among male-headed and female-headed cocoa households in the Juaboso-Bia cocoa landscape. Thus, this study sought to explore the dietary diversity distribution, food security status, sources of staple food, food unavailability periods, food production status, themes contributing to low dietary diversity and food insecurity, and perception of the impact of cocoa expansion on crop diversification among male-headed and female-headed cocoa households in the study area. Methods: Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were employed to address the research questions. The study collected 200 semi-structured questionnaire data and 14 in-depth interview data from cocoa household heads in the Juaboso-Bia landscape. The survey data was cleaned and analysis, such as household dietary diversity status, food security status, and binary logistic regression were performed in the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS). The in-depth interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Through this study, it was revealed that 62.8% of the male-headed cocoa households had medium to high dietary diversity compared to their female counterparts 39.3%. About 47.9% of the male-headed households were food secure than the female-headed households (29.1%). Moreover, the months that both male and female-headed households recalled facing severe food unavailability were July and June. In addition, climate change/variability, unavailable lands, poverty, large household size, and gender stereotypes were themes promoting low dietary diversity and food insecurity among male and female-headed households. Furthermore, sex, total household income, and cropland conversion to cocoa were the variables influencing household heads’ perception of the impact of cocoa expansion on crop diversification. Conclusions: The study showed that the male-headed cocoa households had high dietary diversity and were food secure than the female-headed cocoa households, lending credence to the conceptual framework applied in this study. There is a significant relationship between household head gender and food security status. Therefore, this study recommends the following interventions to improve dietary diversity and food security among male and female-headed cocoa households: raise awareness about the need for diverse diets and provide practical information on how to incorporate a greater variety of food groups into their daily meals; and promote gender equity and inclusivity in food security interventions. Future research could investigate how gender mainstreaming policies in agriculture have helped empower and improve the food security of female-headed households in Ghana. © The Author(s) 2024.","Crop diversification; Dietary diversity score; Food security; Mixed research methods; Nutrition; Rural cocoa household","Diet; Family Characteristics; Female; Food Security; Food Supply; Ghana; Humans; Male; Malnutrition; Meals; catering service; diet; family structure; female; food security; Ghana; human; male; malnutrition; meal","M.

Food eco-labels are on the rise worldwide as consumers and authorities are increasingly demanding them. However, there is a lack of scientific studies estimating the environmental impacts of Uruguayan citrus production. This study aims to assess the environmental performance of lemon production in Uruguay taking into account inter-seasonal variability by applying the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology and following the Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) guidelines. A cradle-to-farm gate assessment was carried out based on both mass and spatial functional units. Primary data was gathered from a representative orchard of the region for four harvest seasons (2016–2020). Environmental impact categories recommended by EN 15804 + A2 standard were assessed. Specifically, blue water scarcity was assessed using the AWARE method. In addition, human and freshwater ecotoxicity were assessed using USEtox. Results show that on-field emissions and input production are critical for most of the categories assessed (on average, 84% CC, 88% Ac, 98% MEu, and 85% TEu), whereas blue water consumed for irrigation is the main hotspot in blue water scarcity (86%, on average). As expected, inter-seasonal impacts present higher variability when expressing results per tonne vs. per hectare because, although agricultural inputs applied are the same, climatic variability influences water requirements and also affects yield. Blue water scarcity exhibits the highest variability because water consumption depends strongly on agroclimatic conditions, mainly on rain and irrigated water and on water dynamics in soil. Nitrate leaching is a key emission for freshwater eutrophication and, to a minor degree, for climate change, which also depends on the water dose and timing, either from rain or irrigation. Optimising the N application is crucial to minimise on-field emissions, a hotspot in the present study. Along these lines, improved agricultural practices are suggested to enhance the environmental profile of Uruguayan lemons. Replacement or minimisation of the dose of certain inputs (e.g., copper oxide) through the implementation of complementary agricultural practices is suggested. Finally, up-to-date techniques to decrease blue water scarcity are proposed. Methodological recommendations for future studies include modelling N emissions using mechanistic models, incorporating potential reductions in N emissions due to certain agricultural practices, and harmonizing the methodology to quantify water consumption. This study sets a baseline LCA for Uruguayan citrus fruit production. It highlights inter-seasonal variability as an issue to be considered, even when agricultural practices do not change, and especially relevant in countries with high climatic variability like Uruguay. The study also provides scientific and quantitative evidence to support the environmental decisions of both citrus producers and consumers. © 2022 The Authors","Agricultural sustainability; Citrus fruit; Environmental impacts; Inter-seasonal variability; Life cycle assessment","Agriculture; Animals; Citrus; Humans; Life Cycle Stages; Seasons; Uruguay; Water; Uruguay; Agricultural pollution; Citrus fruits; Climate change; Copper oxides; Cultivation; Emission control; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Farms; Field emission; Irrigation; Rain; Sustainable development; Water management; blue water; calcium carbonate; fresh water; nitrogen; pesticide; rain; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; water; Agricultural practices; Agricultural sustainability; Blue water; Fresh Water; Hotspots; Inter-seasonal variability; Life cycle assessment; Seasonal variability; Uruguay; Water scarcity; copper compound; eutrophication; freshwater ecosystem; leaching; life cycle analysis; absorption; Article; citrus fruit; climate change; ecosystem service; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; eutrophication; evapotranspiration; harvest period; irrigation (agriculture); land use; lemon; life cycle assessment; moisture; nitrate leaching; nonhuman; orchard; plant yield; precipitation; relative humidity; seasonal variation; sediment; soil; temperature; Uruguay; water insecurity; water supply; wilting point; wind speed; agriculture; animal; Citrus; human; life cycle stage; procedures; season; Uruguay; Life cycle","M.I.

The United Nations has identified the eradication of poverty worldwide as the first priority of its Sustainable Development Goals. However, poverty in old age is not given a specific place in this effort, despite the fact that developed societies are all ageing, with an increasing proportion of the population over 65 years. Financial insecurity in old age can lead to poverty and social exclusion, which is largely a matter for the pension system to prevent and tackle, and to a lesser extent for financial readiness and conscious preparation. In our study, we address the relationship between old age poverty and financial awareness, using data from 25 European countries to identify groups that can be considered similar from aspects of poverty, pension systems, macroeconomic factors, and some aspects of financial awareness. Using clustering, we found that the countries studied can be divided into four distinct clusters, with all combinations of financial readiness and old age poverty. The results could help decision makers identify intervention points to reduce poverty in old age. © ECMS Enrico Vicario, Romeo Bandinelli, Virginia Fani, Michele Mastroianni (Editors) 2023.","cluster analysis; financial awareness; Old age poverty; SHARE","Decision making; Finance; Clusterings; European Countries; Financial awareness; Not given; Old age; Old age poverty; Pension system; SHARE; Social exclusion; United Nations; Cluster analysis","Á.

In order to mitigate the effects of extreme isolation and containment measures, governments have taken steps to protect the health, the economy, employment, and socially vulnerable groups. The health crisis should be treated as a pretext in order to ensure universal access to health and socioeconomics. The aim of this review was the presentation of the way the pandemic contributed to the worldwide deterioration of health inequities affecting in parallel the social protection in the health, economic and educational sector along with other factors, the effects and the measures taken, in order to face the consequences of a pandemic on the social protection in Greece in comparison with other countries of Europe. Methods: A cross-sectional bibliographic study was undertaken using keywords and phrases such as “COVID-19,” “Health inequities,” “Social protection,” and “Social identifiers.” The search was done through the search engines google scholar, PubMed, Health link, and Elsevier using either the Greek or English language. The total number of evaluated read-used articles was 30. Inclusion criteria were free full-text meta-analyses, reviews, and systematic reviews. Results: The socially disadvantaged groups in the United States were found to have a lower life expectancy and higher morbidity rates than privileged social groups, as economic, health, and sociocultural precariousness are major causes of death. Patients with underlying diseases are vulnerable groups and increase the risk of coronavirus infection and quite often lead to loss of life due to complications of the disease. Greece is ranked in the 4th worst position with 61.10% in employment in all European Union (EU) countries. There is a significant increase in deaths with a percentage change from 2018 to date of 17.50%. It also holds the 3rd worst position among EU countries in the field of unemployment, while women hold the 2nd worst with a rate of 13.50%. Overworked and overindebted households due to extreme measures due to the pandemic (reduction of working time, quarantine) led to unemployment, loss of income, poverty, widening social inequalities, and deteriorating care for people with disabilities. Children due to the closure of schools and the loss of school meals are led to food insecurity. The pandemic also left many children orphaned after the death of their parents by COVID-19, with psychosocial problems exacerbated by school closures. Conclusions: The pandemic has exacerbated long-standing health and socioeconomic inequalities, stressing to governments the need to adopt political strategies that will help address them. Measures have been taken in Greece for labor protection, and unemployment benefits, such as the two-month extension of the subsidy period for the unemployed and the long-term unemployed. Minimum insurance days have also been reduced so that citizens employed in tourism, catering, and other seasonal occupations can receive unemployment benefits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","COVID-19; Determinants of health; Economic inequality; Health inequities; Welfare State","Child; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Greece; Humans; Pandemics; Socioeconomic Factors; cause of death; coronavirus disease 2019; food insecurity; Greece; hand washing; health care access; health care cost; health disparity; health insurance; household income; human; infection risk; lockdown; psychosocial disorder; quarantine; social distancing; social inequality; social support; socioeconomics; unemployment; vulnerable population; working time; child; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; female; pandemic","M.

Consequently, studies have examined the determinants of solar PV adoption and identified environmental factors such as environmental concern and environmental knowledge as significant predictors of pro-environmental behavioral intentions, including the intention to adopt, intention to use, purchase intention, and overall sustainable behavioral intention. This study conducts a systematic review of existing research on household solar PV adoption and performs a meta-analysis using a Random-effects model to examine the combined effect sizes of environmental concern and environmental knowledge factors on the four pro-environmental behavioral intention variables (PEBI). A total of 23 studies with 42 observations (N = 18,106 across 7 countries) are included in the meta-analysis. The results show moderate positive correlations between environmental knowledge and PEBI (z = 0.48, p(z) < 0.001), as well as between environmental concern and PEBI (z = 0.39, p(z) < 0.001), indicating significant effects despite the presence of high heterogeneity among the effect sizes. Subgroup analyses are conducted to assess the variability in effect sizes among environmental knowledge and concern with PEBI in rural and urban households, as well as in higher-grade solar PV-based systems and lower-grade solar PV-based products. The findings reveal no significant differences in the effect sizes of environmental factors on PEBI between rural and urban household subgroups. However, in the solar PV technology subgroups, significant differences are observed. These findings provide valuable insights for academia, practitioners, and stakeholders in the renewable energy domain. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental concern; Environmental knowledge; Meta-analysis; Photovoltaic; Pro-environmental behavioral intention; Rural households; Solar PV adoption","Economic and social effects; Environmental technology; Factor analysis; Random processes; Solar power generation; Behavioral intention; Effect size; Environmental concerns; Environmental knowledge; Meta-analysis; Photovoltaics; Pro-environmental behavioral intention; Rural households; Solar PV adoption; Solar PVs; Climate change","V.K.

It generated a worldwide shock, which might have a long-lasting effect on individuals' careers. Changes might occur in terms of individuals’ career choices, objectives, perception of career success and preferences in terms of industries and work arrangements. This study aims to examine crisis-induced career shock among the workforce, which might be translated into changes or doubts related to career choices, objectives and perception of career success, and to analyze individuals' preferences in terms of industries and work arrangements. It focuses mainly on investigating variations among the workforce, based on gender, education level and ethnic origin. These variations are also examined regarding job insecurity, layoff and perceived employability. Design/methodology/approach: Frequency counts, percentages, mean ranking, independent t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for a sample of 317 workers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Three research questions were developed and examined, which are: (1) is there a variation in the workforce, based on gender, education level and ethnic origin concerning crisis-induced career shock (specifically changes related to career choices, objectives and career success? (2) Is there a variation among the workforce related to career preference per industry and work arrangement? If yes, is there a difference in the workforce-based gender, education level and ethnic origin? And (3) is there a variation in the workforce, based on gender, education level and ethnic origin concerning job insecurity, layoff and perceived employability? Findings: The findings revealed that career shock was significantly higher among pre-university respondents (specifically, doubts about career choices and perceived career success). As for career preferences per industry, e-business, media and marketing had significant values for all respondents, with e-business as the top-rated choice except for Emiratis who rated it as their third choice. Education was the choice of both men and women. The choices related to other industries (e.g. Healthcare, information, communication technology, etc.) and work arrangements (telework) varied significantly based on gender, education and ethnic origin. Men seem to worry more than women about losing their job as well as Emiratis compared to expatriates, and university-level respondents compared to pre-university. Practical implications: This study contributes to highlighting variations related to career shock and career preferences per industry among the workforce based on gender, education level and ethnic origin. This can help organizations in these industries to have a portrait of the situation in the employment market to be able to develop relevant interventions. This research provides insights for managers and HRM practitioners. Originality/value: This study contributes to expanding research on career and career shocks in a context of a crisis. It responded to authors who called for more research about career shocks, as well as their implication for specific target groups, by examining variations based on gender, education level and ethnic origin. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Career; Career choices; Career shocks; Career success; COVID-19; Human resource management","","S.

One recent study examined grief in a college student sample and found students with a diverse racial or ethnic background were more likely to experience prolonged grief disorder, however, did not examine poverty in their sample. To date, no known reviews have examined poverty by racial and ethnic identity and the experience of grief due to the death of a family member or friend, and no reviews have examined how these three factors relate to interventions designed to support student academic performance and degree completion. Methods: Our aim is to map the primary literature reporting on college students of any age who identify or are identified as non-white racial or ethnic groups who experience poverty and grief due to the death of a family member or friend. The mapping strategy includes extracting the various types of interventional support of academic performance and degree completion delivered from campus or community services in any geographic setting worldwide. We will conduct our scoping review with guidance from the latest version of the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. Utilizing the framework as outlined by Arksey and O’Malley, we will conduct our scoping review with Arksey’s five stages: (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) study selection, (4) charting the data, and (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. For transparency and reproducibility, we will adhere to the PRISMA reporting guidelines. Discussion: The purpose of this scoping review is to map the primary literature reporting college students, regardless of their age, who belong to non-white racial or ethnic groups and face poverty and grief resulting from the loss of a family member or friend. This analysis includes mapping the various types of intervention and support available both on and off campus, in any global setting, with the aim of enhancing academic performance and facilitating degree completion. The results of this review may inform the further research needed in this area to help prevent poor academic performance and dropout for many vulnerable college students. The results may be of value, particularly to college administrators developing prevention and interventional programs to support college student success.

This is partially due to the homogenization of the global food supply with commodity crops. The reintroduction or introduction of neglected and underutilized species, minor, forgotten, and indigenous crops and landrace varieties to the wider food systems and further diversification have been outlined as the future strategies for tackling the above by the United Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organization in their policy frameworks. Most of the above species/crops are marginalized and only used across local food systems and in research. With over 15,000 different seed banks and repositories worldwide, information transparency and communication are crucial for database searching and their effective utilization. Much confusion persists around the true nature of those plants, and this prohibits the efficient utilization of their economic potential. A linguistic corpus search and a systematic literature review were conducted using the six most popular collocates to the above terms, which were as follows: ancient, heirloom, heritage, traditional, orphan, and the more distinct term ‘landrace’. The results were interpreted using the Critical Discourse Analysis method. The definitions’ findings show that heirloom, heritage, and ancient are mainly used in the United Kingdom and USA, where they are used to describe ‘naturalized’ and ‘indigenized’ or ‘indigenous’ food crops with a strong affiliation to ‘family’ and the ‘act of passing seeds down from generation to generation’. Orphan crops, on the other hand, are often described as being ‘overlooked’ by growers and ‘underfunded’ by researchers. Landrace is most strongly affiliated with ‘locality’, ‘biocultural diversity’, and ‘indigenous’, and with genomics literature, where the characteristics are often discussed in the context of genetics and population biology. Contextualizing, most of the terms were found to be ‘arbitrary’ and ‘undefinable’ due to their continuing evolution in the socially accepted form of language, perhaps apart from landrace. The review has retrieved 58 definitions for the mentioned 6 terms, together with the primary key terms creating a tool to facilitate a better inter-sector communication and aid in policy. © 2023 by the authors.","ancient crops; heirloom; heritage; landrace; orphan crops; underutilized food crops","","A.

Many of them are rich in essential nutrients with the potential for dietary and nutrition improvement particularly for poor households. They are, however, often overlooked. This study investigated diversity, consumption frequency, and perceptions of IWEPs and the contribution they make to the food security of communities in Turkana County, northern Kenya. Our findings are aimed at stimulating targeted discussions among stakeholders involved in food security programs on best way to overcome the poverty stigma associated with IWEPs consumption and to promote their utilization for food security, nutritional and dietary improvement, and enhanced community resilience. Methods: Applying a mixed-methods approach, we collected data using 12 gender-disaggregated focus group discussions and a questionnaire applied to a random sample of 360 households. Results and Discussion: Participants identified 73 IWEPs, of which 24 were consumed in the preceding six months by 48.5% of households. Almost all surveyed households (96%) were classified as severely food insecure, and food insecurity did not differ significantly between households that consumed IWEPs and those that did not. Our results indicate that more IWEPs consumers than non-consumers reported eating foods they had not wanted to consume to cope with food scarcity, as well as having to eat fewer meals than normal. Just over half of the respondents (57.1%) held positive attitudes towards IWEPs, which was positively associated with a higher likelihood of IWEPs consumption. Long distances to harvest sites, lack of knowledge about the plants, their seasonality, and how to cook them appetizingly, coupled with overall unfavorable perceptions, are probable reasons for non-consumption of IWEPs among the survey respondents. In line with other studies cited on wild foods, we conclude that IWEPs have the potential to bridge food and nutritional deficits in food insecure households in the study area, although currently their consumption remains limited. Given this potential, further analysis of IWEPs’ nutritional composition and restoration of wild edible foods to local areas should be given priority, as well as interventions that help to overcome the challenges to their consumption and promote their wider use.

However, little is known about how taxation on these products may affect their demand. The present study aims to estimate the price elasticity of demand for sugar-sweetened beverages in Brazil. This study advances the literature by proposing a breakdown between ready-to-drink sugar-sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened beverages that require some preparation before being consumed. With this disaggregation, it is possible to obtain more accurate elasticities for the group of products that will be effectively taxed. We estimated a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model using the Household Budget Survey 2017–2018 microdata. The results show that ready-to-drink beverages is more consumed but less sensitive to changes in price than prepared beverages. The price elasticity of demand for ready-to-drink and prepared sugar-sweetened beverages was -1.19 and -3.38. Additionally, we observe heterogeneity in these price elasticities across household incomes, with a more elastic demand among lower-income households for ready to drink beverages. The findings suggest that taxing ready-to-drink sweetened beverages could potentially reduce sugar consumption directly through a decrease in the consumption of sugary drinks and this effect could be reinforced by reducing the consumption of other sugar-rich products. Therefore, the taxation police should effective contribute to minimize health risks associated to the sugar consumption. © 2023 Venson et al.

Furthermore, due to the pandemic, several food organizations have been prompted to rethink their strategies for the future. Although the literature on FSC research in the COVID-19 era is increasing, no attempt has been made to summarize this stream of research using bibliometric techniques. This paper fills this knowledge gap and looks at the current scholarly discourse around the FSC and COVID-19. Applying bibliometric techniques, 287 journal articles were extracted from Scopus and analyzed to determine the temporal evolution of FSC research, the most productive journals, researchers, countries, and the most relevant keywords and publications. To construct a keyword co-occurrence network and categorize the relevant literature, we used the computer program VOSviewer. The findings demonstrate the rapid expansion of FSC research during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the top authors, publications, and nations for scientific output were also determined. Keyword co-occurrence network and detailed qualitative analysis both illustrate that FSC research revolves around six main themes: the impact of COVID-19 on the FSC and agriculture, FSC resilience, food waste and insecurity, fisheries and aquaculture, blockchain technology, and governance and innovation. This study represents the first effort to map worldwide FSC research in the COVID-19 era and draw on a comprehensive collection of journal articles and bibliometric approaches. It offers academics, practitioners, and decision-makers a snapshot of the state of the art in the FSC field and points to where further research is needed. © 2022 by the authors.","bibliometric; COVID-19; food security; food supply chain; food waste","COVID-19; expansion; food security; food supply; food waste; software","S.

Yet, climate response mechanisms too may generate similar implications, which may increase the likelihood of conflicts and human displacements. Focusing on adaptation, as one of the mainstays of climate change governance, this chapter aims to highlight that related policies and actions may, in some instances, generate unexpected outcomes and risks which erode resilience instead of building it. To substantiate this, the analysis investigates the drivers, forms, and manifestations of maladaptation by reference to existing theoretical and empirical research. Accordingly, the maladaptation and migration nexus is analyzed from an inclusive governance and science-based policy making perspective. Alternative approaches to address maladaptation to ensure resilience and sustainability through adaptation strategies are identified and discussed as well. Throughout the chapter, the analysis prescribes the needed guidelines to be considered while elaborating, implementing, and evaluating adaptation actions to ensure the achievement of expected outcomes and to avoid potential tradeoffs and negative implications. Results show that some adaptation strategies and interventions in many contexts have undermined the balance of ecosystems and the resilience of local communities, creating additional conditions for increased human insecurity, including the compulsion to migrate. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Adaptation; Climate change; Maladaptation; Mitigation; Social-ecological vulnerability","","M.

In Europe, the Reach Regulation has registered more than 100.000 chemical substances daily released in the environment. Furthermore, the effects related to the mixture of substances present in aquatic ecosystems may not be predictable on the basis of chemical analyses alone. This evidence, coupled with the dramatic effects of climate changes on water resources through water scarcity and flooding, makes urgent the application of innovative, fast and reliable monitoring methods. In this context, Effect-Based Methods (EBMs) have been applied in the urban stretch of the Tiber River (Central Italy) with the aim of understanding if detrimental pressures affect aquatic environmental health. In particular, different eco-genotoxicological assays have been used in order to detect genotoxic activity of chemicals present in the river, concurrently characterized by chemical analysis. Teratogenicity and embryo-toxicity have been studied in order to cover additional endpoints. The EBMs have highlighted the presence of diffuse chemical pollution and ecotoxicological effects in the three sampling stations, genotoxicological effects have been also detected through the use of different tests and organisms. The chemical analyses confirmed that in the aquatic ecosystems there is a diffuse presence, even at low concentrations, of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, not routinely monitored pesticides, personal care products, PFAS. The results of this study can help to identify an appropriate battery of EBMs for future studies and the application of more appropriate measures in order to monitor, mitigate or eliminate chemical contamination and remediate its adverse/detrimental effects on the ecosystem health. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic ecosystems; Ecotoxicity; Effect-based methods; Emerging pollutants; Genotoxicity; Water quality","DNA Damage; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality; Italy; Tiber River; Varanidae; Aquatic ecosystems; Climate change; Indicators (chemical); Quality control; River pollution; Rivers; pesticide; Chemical analyse; Chemical water; Ecotoxicity; Effect-based method; Emerging pollutants; Genotoxicities; Integrated approach; Pollutant analysis; Urban river; Water quality assessments; aquatic ecosystem; assessment method; chemical pollutant; ecotoxicology; genotoxicity; integrated approach; river water; water quality; aquatic environment; Article; climate change; controlled study; ecosystem health; embryotoxicity; environmental health; genotoxicity; Italy; river; teratogenicity; water availability; water insecurity; water pollutant; water quality; water supply; analysis; DNA damage; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; pollutant; river; toxicity; water quality; Water quality","M.

This study assessed the impact of household economic strengthening (HES) intervention on food security among caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Tanzania. The study was longitudinal in design, based on OVC caregivers’ baseline (2017–2018) and midline (2019) data from the USAID Kizazi Kipya project. Food security, the outcome, was measured using the Household Hunger Scale (HHS) in three categories: little to no hunger (food secure), moderate hunger, and severe hunger. Membership in the USAID Kizazi Kipya-supported economic strengthening intervention (i.e. WORTH Yetu) was the main independent variable. Data analysis involved generalized estimating equation (GEE) for multivariate analysis. With mean age of 50.3 years at baseline, the study analyzed 132,583 caregivers, 72.2% of whom were female. At midline, 7.6% of all caregivers enrolled at baseline were members in WORTH Yetu. Membership in WORTH Yetu was significantly effective in reducing household hunger among the caregivers: severe hunger dropped from 9.4% at baseline to 4.1% at midline; moderate hunger dropped from 65.9% at baseline to 62.8% at midline; and food security (i.e., little to no hunger households) increased from 25.2% at baseline to 33.1% at midline. In the multivariate analysis, membership in WORTH Yetu reduced the likelihood of severe hunger by 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.48–0.59), and moderate hunger by 21% (OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.76–0.83), but increased the likelihood of food security by 45% (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.39–1.51). The USAID Kizazi Kipya’s model of household economic strengthening for OVC caregivers was effective in improving food security and reducing household hunger in Tanzania. This underscores the need to expand WORTH Yetu coverage. Meanwhile, these results indicate a potential of applying the intervention in similar settings to address household hunger. © 2022 Exavery et al.","","Adolescent; Adult; Caregivers; Child; Child, Orphaned; Child, Preschool; Female; Food Security; Humans; Hunger; Male; Middle Aged; Tanzania; adult; article; caregiver; child; controlled study; data analysis; female; food security; household; human; hunger; independent variable; middle aged; Tanzania; adolescent; clinical trial; hunger; male; multicenter study; orphaned child; preschool child; Tanzania","A.

This study sought to review the quality management strategies, policies and practices of two higher education institutions (HEIs) in the non-regime conflict-affected northwest of Syria (NWS), selected as representative of the emerging HE sector in the area since 2015, and to explore the potential benefits of a risk-management approach to quality assurance, a model that places context at its heart to help mitigate identified risks that might undermine delivery of quality HE. A mixed-method approach, was adopted, combining an analysis of the two HEIs administrative documents, with fourteen semi-structured interviews with senior administrative and teaching staff, and a survey of 120 of their 2019/20 graduates. Findings indicated that a risk-management approach would allow HEIs in NWS to develop strategies, policies and practices that would better respond to their conflict-affected realities, and the need for a more transparent and democratic management approach to decision-making and management/staff/student relations and communication. A set of risk-management quality assurance recommendations are offered for consideration by all Syrian HEIs in NWS, to allow the development of management policies, strategies and practices that mitigate risks to delivery of quality HE services. Equally important is to acknowledge the resilience and adaptability of the two study universities, and their commitment to sustaining access to HE for local and displaced communities, despite ongoing insecurity and deteriorating economic and social conditions. © 2022","Higher education; North-West Syria; Quality management; Risk management","","M.

The objective of this study was to understand the enablers and barriers of accessing fundamental health and social services for migrants in precarious housing situations. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies. We searched the databases of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, Social Sciences, Canadian Business & Current Affairs and Sociological Abstracts for articles published between Jan. 1, 2007, and Feb. 9, 2020. We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate, and used a framework synthesis approach, the Bierman model for migration, to guide our analysis of the experiences of migrant populations experiencing homelessness or vulnerable housing in high-income countries. We critically appraised the quality of included studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist and assessed confidence in key findings using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) approach. RESULTS: We identified 1039 articles, and 18 met our inclusion criteria. The studies focused on migrants from Asia and Africa who resettled in Canada, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and other European countries. Poor access to housing services was related to unsafe housing, facing a family separation, insufficient income assistance, immigration status, limited employment opportunities and lack of language skills. Enablers to accessing appropriate housing services included finding an advocate and adopting survival and coping strategies. INTERPRETATION: Migrants experiencing homelessness and vulnerable housing often struggle to access health and social services; migrants may have limited proficiency with the local language, limited access to safe housing and income support, and ongoing family insecurities. Public health leaders could develop outreach programs that address access and discrimination barriers.

This challenge is magnified with growing evidence of climate change and related water supply stressors. This stress will challenge food, energy, and water systems as climate adaptation policy measures see continued debate. Despite numerous achievements made many by previous works, few attempts have scanned the literature on economic optimization analysis for water resources planning to discover affordable climate adaptation measures. This paper aims to fill that gap by reviewing the literature on water resource optimization analysis at the basin scale to guide discovery of affordable climate adaptation measures. It does so by posing the question “What principles, practices, and recent developments are available to guide discovery of policy measures to improve water resource system adaptions to growing evidence of climate water stress?” It describes past achievements and identifies improvements needed for optimization analysis to inform policy debates for crafting plans to improve climate resilience. It describes an economic conceptual framework as well as identifying data needs for conducting economic optimization exercises to support river basin planning faced by the challenge of managing the six water dimensions described above. It presents an example from an ongoing issue facing water planners in the Middle East. Conclusions find considerable utility in the use of economic optimization exercises to guide climate water stressadaptation.

The global population is predicted to reach 8 billion by the end of 2022, which can delay the progress and exacerbate the challenges of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the goal of “Zero Hunger.” What is added by this report? During the next 15 years, it is predicted that the world’s population will increase from 8 billion to 9 billion people. Although food insecurity is anticipated to decrease over the next three decades for most of the world, food insecurity is anticipated to increase in Africa. Accelerating population growth is projected to lead to larger percentages of infants with low birth weight and of children under 5 years old with stunted growth. What are the implications for public health practice? Rapid population growth will make it more difficult to achieve the SDGs for ending hunger and ensuring good health and well-being.

Thus, studies on water security in a changing climate help decision-makers to overcome existing political and socioeconomic challenges worldwide. In this study, future water security of two basins was assessed under climate change and demand scenarios by contrasting water demand with probabilistic levels of water availability to identify possible drivers of insecurity. The Guariroba and Jaguari basins are the main sources for supplying water to Campo Grande city and the São Paulo Metropolitan Region, respectively. The physically-based SWAT+ model was calibrated to simulate the basins’ hydrological response to three climate change scenarios from a CMIP6 multimodel ensemble: SSP2-4.5 (medium forcing), SSP3-7.0 (high forcing), and SSP5-8.5 (high forcing). The Guariroba basin already presented scarcity indices close to the security threshold in the baseline period. The imbalance between availability and demand was the main driver of water insecurity in this basin. Despite showing a low scarcity risk in the Jaguari basin in the baseline, this risk considerably increased in the future periods due to a decrease in precipitation. A reduction in water demand of 20% by 2070 was not sufficient to improve water security in both basins. These findings indicate that a lack of policies for adapting demand to a changing availability exacerbates hydrological droughts. More stringent measures to balance water availability and demand are critical for improving water security in an uncertain future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate extremes; Hydrological droughts; Water management; Water shortages","Brazil; Jaguari Basin; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)]; Climate change; Climate models; Decision making; Drought; Climate change impact; Climate extremes; Climate variability; Forcings; Hydrological droughts; Water demand; Water security; Water shortages; Water vulnerabilities; Waters managements; climate change; decision making; demand analysis; future prospect; uncertainty analysis; vulnerability; water availability; water budget; water demand; water management; water storage; water supply; Water management","J.S.

Developing ways to reduce irrigation to maintain soil fertility and ensure crop yield by regulating the root microenvironment is an important research goal. Here, we developed a reasonable irrigation plan for eggplant cultivation in a solar greenhouse. The maximum theoretical amount of water demand during eggplant planting obtained from a previous study was used as the control (CK), and the irrigation in the treatments was reduced by 10, 20 and 30% relative to this amount. The 10% irrigation reduction treatment (T1) significantly improved soil nutrients and increased soil catalase, urease and alkaline phosphatase activities (p < 0.05). Further analysis of rhizosphere microorganisms revealed the highest richness and diversity of the microbial community under the T1 treatment, with Bacilli as the most abundant bacteria and Aspergillaceae as the most abundant fungi and lower relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria (p < 0.05). Changes in microbial community structure under the influence of different irrigation treatments resulted in improvements in rhizosphere N cycling and nutrient catabolism. The plant–microbe interactions led to significant increases in eggplant plant height, root vigour, root surface area, leaf chlorophyll a, leaf net photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance under the T1 treatment compared to the CK treatment; soluble sugar, soluble protein and free amino acid contents in eggplant fruit increased by 10.8, 12.3 and 6.7%, respectively; and yield increased by 3.9%. Our research proved that the 10% irrigation reduction treatment (T1) could improve microbial community richness and fruit yield, which would improve irrigation efficiency and cost reduction in agriculture.

However, food insecurity remains pervasive, contributing to socioeconomic health inequalities. The overall objective was to investigate the relationship between food insecurity and intentional injuries among adolescents. Methods Individual-level data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey from 89 countries were used (370 719 adolescents, aged 12-17 years). Multilevel logistic regressions were used to examine the sex-specific association between the level of food insecurity (none, medium and high) and intentional injuries (interpersonal violence and suicide attempts), accounting for the clustering of observations within surveys. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to analyse dose-response relationships. Results Medium and high food insecurity were associated with increased odds of reporting an injury from interpersonal violence among both sexes. A positive dose-response relationship was found, where each level increase in food insecurity was associated with a 30% increase in the odds of an injury due to interpersonal violence among boys (1.30; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.34) and a 50% increase among girls (1.53; 95% CI 1.46-1.62). The odds for suicide attempts increased by 30% for both sexes with each level increase in food insecurity (boys: 1.29; 95% CI 1.25-1.32; girls: 1.29; 95% CI 1.25-1.32). Discussion The findings indicate that socioeconomic inequalities exist in the risk of intentional injuries among adolescents. Although additional studies are needed to establish causality, the present study suggests that the amelioration of food insecurity could have implications beyond the prevention of its direct consequences.  © Authors 2021","adolescent; global; health disparities; hierarchical models; suicide/self?harm; violence","Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Schools; Socioeconomic Factors; Suicide, Attempted; Violence; adolescent; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; school; socioeconomics; suicide attempt; violence","C.

Environmental insecurity and climate change have been accepted worldwide as nonconventional ravage to economic development and security concerns. The divesting impacts of climate change have jeopardized the sovereignty, socioeconomic, political, national, and environmental security across the world. South Asia, a habitat of most vulnerable people to climate change has already agonized the damage due to climate and musing the risk to sustainable future. This chapter has built dynamics of environmental security, environmental security and sustainable development, climate change scenario in South Asia, the analysis of climate change policies and plans in South Asia, coherence of policies and procedures with the Paris Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Thimphu Statement on Climate Change, and the relationship of climate change with environmental security. The Multi-criteria Decision Analysis has been employed to determine the relationship of climate change with environmental security, coherence of policies and procedures in the region with the Paris Agreement and Thimphu Statement on Climate Change, and rationalize the quest for environmental diplomacy as pursuance to cooperation. Thirty-two technical, economic, environmental, social, and political criteria had been selected and tested. The results had demonstrated gaps in around 20 criteria that include low institutional capacity, less coherence with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs as well as limiting the implementation of proposed mitigation and adaptation measures.

The impacts of climate change started to become more visible and related migration and conflict became issues of social and political concern, which has been captured by researchers worldwide. This chapter examines the trends in research on the climate-conflict-migration nexus (326 publications), and broadly on climate migration and refugee concerns (10, 138 publications) from 1990 to 2019, using bibliometric indicators. The study materials were sourced from the Scopus database, a bibliographical and citation database which provides access to quality content. For the 326 nexus publications, we capture the geographic distribution, major subdomains viz, consequence/impact, security/insecurity, policy, health, solution, migration and conflict, top authors engaged in this research, and the top funders. This helped us understand and reflect on the major gaps in the research output and how this could shape future debate on climate-related migration. The findings reveal that research publications have been rising exponentially in the last few years, with a noticeable peak in 2018. The cumulative world output on climate migration and conflict issues increased from 724 (7.14%) publications in the 15 years between 1990 and 2004 to 9413 (92.84%) in the succeeding 15 years from 2005 to 2019. The United States of America record the highest number of publications in this research area. So far, there is less research on the solutions side, thus there is a need to reflect on how this fast-emerging concern can be tackled globally, given that each country is exposed to climate risks but with differentiated vulnerability and adaptive capacities. Large-scale cross-border migration can create resource deficits, thus worsening existing conflicts or shaping new ones. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Bibliometrics; Climate change; Conflict; Human security; Migration","","H.

Design: A secondary data analysis was conducted using cross-sectional data from the Colombian National Nutritional Survey (ENSIN) 2015. Household food insecurity status was assessed by using the Latin-American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (ELCSA). The household SCOWT status (child stunting and OWOB mother) was determined using anthropometric data from a mother and her child. Setting: Rural Colombia. Participants: Totally, 2·350 mother-child pairs living in the same household. Results: Sixty-two per cent of the households were food-insecure and SCOWT was present in 7·8 % of the households. Moderate (OR: 2·39, 95 % CI (1·36, 4·21)) and severe (OR: 1·86, 95 % CI (1·10, 3·15)) food insecurity was associated with SCOWT in an unadjusted logistic regression. Only moderate food insecurity remained significantly associated with SCOWT in a multivariate logistic regression (adjusted OR: 2·41, 95 % CI (1·24, 4·68)). Conclusions: Colombian rural areas are not exempt from the worldwide concern of increasing OWOB rates while stunting is still persistent. These results highlight the need of implementing double-duty rural actions targeting the most vulnerable households to SCOWT, particularly in terms of overcoming food insecurity beyond hunger satisfaction to prevent all forms of malnutrition. © The Author(s), 2021.

We employ a large panel data of 5.6 million daily transactions from 2.6 million debit cards owned by the low-income population in the U.S. to quantify the joint impacts of the state lockdowns and stimulus payments on this population’s spending along the inter-temporal, geo-spatial, and cross-categorical dimensions. Leveraging the difference-in-differences analyses at the per card and zip code levels, we uncover three key findings. (1) Inter-temporally, the state lockdowns diminished the daily average spending relative to the same period in 2019 by $3.9 per card and $2,214 per zip code, whereas the stimulus payments elevated the daily average spending by $15.7 per card and $3,307 per zip code. (2) Spatial heterogeneity prevailed: Democratic zip codes displayed much more volatile dynamics, with an initial decline three times that of Republican zip codes, followed by a higher rebound and a net gain after the stimulus payments; also, Southwest exhibited the highest initial decline whereas Southeast had the largest net gain after the stimulus payments. (3) Across 26 categories, the stimulus payments promoted spending in those categories that enhanced public health and charitable donations, reduced food insecurity and digital divide, while having also stimulated non-essential and even undesirable categories, such as liquor and cigar. In addition, spatial association analysis was employed to identify spatial dependency and local hot spots of spending changes at the county level. Overall, these analyses reveal the imperative need for more geo- and category-targeted stimulus programs, as well as more effective and strategic policy communications, to protect and promote the well-being of the low-income population during public health and economic crises. © 2021 Li et al.

As food insecurity is worsening worldwide, this issue has attracted attention from the Chinese government. In order to curb this trend and to ensure food security, this paper explores the quantitative characteristics and spatial distribution of cultivated land used for non-grain purposes in Liyang City, Jiangsu Province, and discusses the clustering characteristics and mechanisms behind this based on spatial autocorrelation analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results show that most of the cultivated land in Liyang City has not been used for non-grain purposes, and the cultivated land reserve is abundant. Among all land types, irrigable land has the largest non-grain production rate of cultivated land. There is no significant spatial correlation of cultivated land for non-grain purposes in most towns in Liyang, among which Kunlun Street is in the High-High (HH) zone and Daibu Town in the Low-High (LH) zone. It is also found that the same factor has various impacts on the non-grain production of cultivated land in different towns, and the number of enterprises is the core factor that leads to the non-grain use of cultivated land in Liyang city. Low food prices lead some farmers to plant other crops with higher economic benefits, and also lead to the outflow of the rural labor force. This will not only accelerate the non-grain production of cultivated land, but also cause a large amount of cultivated land to be in a state of unmanned cultivation, further aggravating the proportion of non-grain production in cultivated land. © 2021 by the authors.

Hence, it is crucial to understand the effects of different government programs on overcoming FI. The present population-based longitudinal cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between government programs and household FI among families in a municipality in a semiarid area in Northeast, Brazil. We collected data on 358 families (2011) at baseline and 326 at follow-up (2014). FI was measured with the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale (EBIA). The access to 27 governmental programs was assessed. The association of 15 programs with FI was estimated using logistic regression models and corresponding marginal effects and predicted probabilities. About 24.5% of families who were food insecure in 2011 became food secure in 2014 and 37.4% of families remained food secure across time. More than 90% of families accessed at least one program at baseline, and during follow-up there was an increase in the number of programs received per family. Programs in the areas of health protection, food and water assistance, poverty reduction, and rural developmentwere associated with remaining food secure over time and overcoming FI between baseline and follow-up. In conclusion, access to diverse health, food and social government programs was related to reduced risk of FI. This evidence strongly supports the need to for multisectoral approaches to address the social determinants of health to confront FI. © 2020, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.","Food insecurity; Food security; Government programs; Public Policies","Brazil; cohort analysis; food security; health risk; legislation; longitudinal gradient; measurement method; semiarid region; social problem","P. de Araújo Palmeira; Center of Education and Health, Federal University of Campina Grande, Cuité, Sítio Olho dágua da Bica, S/N, Brazil; email: palmeira.poliana@gmail.com","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","18764517","","","","English","Food Secur.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089983634"

Under the circumstances, electronic mental health (e-mental health) programs and services have rapidly become the “new normal.” Objective: The aim of this study was to assess key characteristics and evidence gaps in the e-mental health literature published in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic via a scoping review and bibliometric analysis. Methods: We conducted a search of four academic databases (ie, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and CINAHL) for documents published from December 31, 2019, to March 31, 2021, using keywords for e-mental health and COVID-19. Article information was extracted that was relevant to the review objective, including journal, type of article, keywords, focus, and corresponding author. Information was synthesized by coding these attributes and was then summarized through descriptive statistics and narrative techniques. Article influence was examined from Altmetric and CiteScore data, and a network analysis was conducted on article keywords. Results: A total of 356 publications were included in the review. Articles on e-mental health quickly thrived early in the pandemic, with most articles being nonempirical, chiefly commentaries or opinions (n=225, 63.2%). Empirical publications emerged later and became more frequent as the pandemic progressed. The United States contributed the most articles (n=160, 44.9%), though a notable number came from middle-income countries (n=59, 16.6%). Articles were spread across 165 journals and had above-average influence (ie, almost half of the articles were in the top 25% of output scores by Altmetric, and the average CiteScore across articles was 4.22). The network analysis of author-supplied keywords identified key topic areas, including specific mental disorders, eHealth modalities, issues and challenges, and populations of interest. These were further explored via full-text analysis. Applications of e-mental health during the pandemic overcame, or were influenced by, system, service, technology, provider, and patient factors. Conclusions: COVID-19 has accelerated applications of e-mental health. Further research is needed to support the implementation of e-mental health across system and service infrastructures, alongside evidence of the relative effectiveness of e-mental health in comparison to traditional modes of care. © Louise A Ellis, Isabelle Meulenbroeks, Kate Churruca, Chiara Pomare, Sarah Hatem, Reema Harrison, Yvonne Zurynski, Jeffrey Braithwaite.","Bibliometrics; COVID-19; E-mental health; Health systems; Mental health","addiction; anxiety disorder; bibliometrics; Cinahl; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; digital technology; eating disorder; Embase; health care delivery; health care policy; health care system; human; internet access; lowest income group; medical literature; Medline; mental disease; mental health care; middle income country; middle income group; mobile application; pandemic; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychosis; psychotherapy; PsycINFO; Review; schizophrenia; statistics; substance abuse; suicide; support group; telehealth; telephone interview; United States; videoconferencing","L.A.

In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have distributed social assistance to more than 1.5 billion people2. Targeting is a central challenge in administering these programmes: it remains a difficult task to rapidly identify those with the greatest need given available data3,4. Here we show that data from mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of humanitarian assistance. Our approach uses traditional survey data to train machine-learning algorithms to recognize patterns of poverty in mobile phone data; the trained algorithms can then prioritize aid to the poorest mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying a flagship emergency cash transfer program in Togo, which used these algorithms to disburse millions of US dollars worth of COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes—including exclusion errors, total social welfare and measures of fairness—under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo, the machine-learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4–21%. Relative to methods requiring a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise; no such registry exists in Togo), the machine-learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9–35%. These results highlight the potential for new data sources to complement traditional methods for targeting humanitarian assistance, particularly in crisis settings in which traditional data are missing or out of date. © 2022, The Author(s).","","COVID-19; Humans; Machine Learning; Pandemics; Poverty; Relief Work; Togo; COVID-19; humanitarian aid; machine learning; mobile phone; poverty; adult; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; extreme poverty; female; human; humanitarian aid; machine learning; male; metadata; pandemic; prediction; public expenditure; questionnaire; register; social welfare; Togo; epidemiology; machine learning; poverty; relief work","J.E.

Methods: The Gallup World Poll data from 2014 to 2019 were analyzed in 2021. A total of 36,313 immigrants and 705,913 nonimmigrants were included. Food insecurity was measured by the Food Insecurity Experience Scale. Mental well-being was assessed using the Negative Experience Index and Positive Experience Index. A community attachment index was used to measure the living environment. Multilevel mixed-effect linear models were used to examine how the Negative Experience Index/Positive Experience Index was associated with food insecurity and the community attachment index in immigrants and nonimmigrants, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, survey years, and country fixed effects. The modifying effects of immigration status on food insecurity–mental well-being associations were tested. Results: The weighted proportion of food insecurity among global immigrants was 38.6% during 2014–2019. In the pooled adjusted model, food insecurity was dose–responsively associated with greater Negative Experience Index and lower Positive Experience Index than the food-secure ref (p<0.001 for trend). Similar dose–response associations were observed in nonimmigrants and in region-specific analyses. Community attachment marginally affected the food insecurity–mental well-being associations (all p≤0.001 for interaction). Immigration status significantly modified the food insecurity–mental well-being associations in all analyses (all p=0.01 for interaction), and immigrants experienced poorer mental well-being than nonimmigrants at the same level of community attachment and food insecurity. Conclusions: Food insecurity is prevalent and is associated with poor mental well-being in immigrants worldwide. Future interventions are needed to alleviate food insecurity and promote community attachment to improve mental health among immigrants, especially in Asian and Pacific countries. © 2022 American Journal of Preventive Medicine","","Emigrants and Immigrants; Food Insecurity; Food Supply; Humans; Mental Health; Surveys and Questionnaires; article; controlled study; demography; dose response; emotional attachment; food insecurity; human; human experiment; immigrant; immigration; mental health; prevalence; psychological well-being; catering service; food insecurity; mental health; migrant; questionnaire","M.

Undernutrition is a serious public health problem in Ethiopia and children are the most affected segments of the population. This study, therefore, sought to investigate the socio-economic, demographic, health and environmental factors associated with undernutrition among children aged 6–59 months in Ethiopia. Data were obtained from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. In this study, anthropometric data (height and weight) and other variables of 9461 children were measured. Descriptive statistics and multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. The descriptive results revealed that about 27.5% of the children aged between 6–59 months were undernourished. Place of residence, employment status of the mother, educational status of the mother, the mother’s nutritional status, age of the child, birth order of children, source of drinking water, diarrhea and fever among children in the two weeks before the survey were the most important factors associated with undernutrition among children aged 6–59 months in Ethiopia. The findings indicate that it is useful to support health care and food security programs in rural areas to directly address food insecurity and undernutrition problems of the poor and exposed communities in rural parts of the country. The education sector must increase mothers’ access to education in all areas to help identify the quality of healthcare and the required attention needed for their children. The health sector should increase their health education programs on the importance of exclusive breastfeeding. © 2021 by the authors.

It causes inflammation of the brain and, if left untreated, can have persistent effects on the central nervous system. Conspicuously, this paper proposes an intelligent cyber-physical healthcare framework based on the IoT–fog–cloud collaborative network, employing soft-computing technology and information fusion. The proposed framework uses IoT-based sensors, electronic medical records, and user devices for data acquisition. The fog layer, composed of numerous nodes, processes the most specific encephalitis symptom-related data to classify possible encephalitis cases in real time to issue an alarm when a significant health emergency occurs. Furthermore, the cloud layer involves a multi-step data processing scheme for in-depth data analysis. First, data obtained across multiple data generation sources are fused to obtain a more consistent, accurate, and reliable feature set. Data preprocessing and feature selection techniques are applied to the fused data for dimensionality reduction over the cloud computing platform. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is applied in the cloud to determine the risk of a disease and classify the results into one of four categories: no risk, probable risk, low risk, and acute risk. Moreover, the alerts are generated and sent to the stakeholders based on the risk factor. Finally, the computed results are stored in the cloud database for future use. For validation purposes, various experiments are performed using real-time datasets. The analysis results performed on the fog and cloud layers show higher performance than the existing models. Future research will focus on the resource allocation in the cloud layer while considering various security aspects to improve the utility of the proposed work. © 2022, Ohmsha, Ltd. and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","ANFIS; F-KNN; Information fusion; Internet of things; Singular vector decomposition","Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Data acquisition; Diagnosis; Fog; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Health care; Information fusion; Internet of things; Soft computing; Central nervous systems; Cloud layers; Contagious disease; Cyber physicals; F-KNN; Health concerns; Singular vector decomposition; Singular vectors; Softcomputing techniques; Vector decompositions; Fuzzy inference","A.

In the recent decades, stem rust races belonging to the Ug99 (TTKSK) and Digalu (TKTTF) race group resurfaced as a major threat in Africa, the Middle East and Europe threatening global wheat production. In addition, the evolution and migration of new aggressive races of yellow rust adapted to warmer temperatures into Europe and Asia from Himalayan region are becoming a significant risk in several wheat production environments. Unique and complex virulence patterns, continuous evolution to overcome effective resistance genes in varieties, shifts in population dynamics, transboundary migration have resulted in localized/regional epidemics leading to food insecurity threats. This underscores the need to identify, characterize, and deploy effective rust resistant genes from diverse sources into pre-breeding lines and future wheat varieties. The use of genetic resistance and deployment of multiple race specific and pleiotropic adult plant resistance genes in wheat lines can enhance resistance durability. Recent advances in sequencing annotated wheat reference genome with a detailed analysis of gene content among sub-genomes will not only accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of rust resistance bread wheat, at the same time wheat breeders can now use this information to identify genes conferring rust resistance. Progress in genetic mapping techniques, new cloning techniques and wheat transformation methods over the last two decades have not only resulted in characterizing new genes and loci but also facilitated rapid cloning and stacking multiple genes as gene cassettes which can be future solution for enhancing durable resistance. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2022, Corrected Publication 2022","Adult plant resistance genes; Breeding technologies; Race specific genes; Rust resistance","","S.

However, a precise measurement is required for the assessment of a child's nutritional status, which may not always be possible due to expensive instruments, especially in poor resource settings. In some instances, mid-upper arm circumference-for-age z-score (MUACZ) is also being used for screening purposes, which is a simple and useful nutritional indicator. The objective of this paper is to identify the optimal cut-off point for the MUACZ to identify wasted children, and also to determine if the same factors are associated with MUACZ and wasting. Data were derived from the Suchana evaluation data. The optimal cut-off value was estimated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using acute malnutrition as a gold standard with maximum sensitivity and specificity. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the associated factors with the MUACZ. Using the gold standard indicator of nonwasting (WLZ ≥ −2), a positive outcome, the optimal cut-off point for the MUACZ was −1.27. The area under the ROC curve was 0.88, indicating that the model had a power of 88% to differentiate between the positive and negative classes. It implies that a child's MUACZ was correlated with WLZ, and a MUACZ below −1.27 appeared to accurately identify wasting among children aged 3–23 months. MUACZ < −1.27 might be another useful indicator of childhood wasting than a WLZ < −2. © 2022 The Authors.

These remote services use their up-to-date information and global context (view) to help classify the files and instruct their agents to take a predetermined action (e.g., delete or quarantine). In this study, we provide a security analysis of a specific form of communication between anti-malware agents and their services, which takes place entirely over the insecure DNS protocol. These services, which we denote DNS anti-malware list (DNSAML) services, affect the classification of files scanned by anti-malware agents, therefore potentially putting their consumers at risk due to known integrity and confidentiality flaws of the DNS protocol. By analyzing a large-scale DNS traffic dataset made available to the authors by a well-known CDN provider, we identify anti-malware solutions that seem to make use of DNSAML services. We found that these solutions, deployed on almost three million machines worldwide, exchange hundreds of millions of DNS requests daily. These requests carry sensitive file scan information, often - as we demonstrate - without any additional safeguards to compensate for the insecurities of the DNS protocol. As a result, these anti-malware solutions that use DNSAML are vulnerable to DNS attacks. For instance, an attacker capable of tampering with DNS queries gains the ability to alter the classification of scanned files, without a presence on the scanning machine. We showcase three attacks applicable to at least three anti-malware solutions that could result in the disclosure of sensitive information and improper behavior by the anti-malware agent, such as ignoring detected threats. Finally, we propose and review a set of countermeasures for anti-malware solution providers to prevent attacks stemming from the use of DNSAML services. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-malware; DNS; Information disclosure","Classification (of information); Internet protocols; Malware; Anti-malware; DNS; DNS traffics; Global context; Information contexts; Information disclosure; Large-scales; Remote services; Scanning machines; Security analysis; Large dataset","A.

Here we report the experience of families from London Borough of Tower Hamlets with high rates of poverty and ethnic and linguistic diversity. This inner city community, like communities worldwide, has experienced a reduction or closure in access to education, support services, and in some cases, a change in or loss of income, job, and food security. Using quantitative survey items (N = 992), we examined what differences in family circumstances, for mothers and fathers of young children aged 0–5 living in Tower Hamlets, during March 2020 to November 2020, were associated with their mental health status. We measure parental mental health using symptoms of depression (self-report: Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale: PHQ-8), symptoms of anxiety levels (self-report: General Anxiety Disorder: GAD-7), and perceptions of direct loneliness. We find parental mental health difficulties are associated with low material assets (financial security, food security, and children having access to outside space), familial assets (parents time for themselves and parent status: lone vs. cohabiting), and community assets (receiving support from friends and family outside the household). South Asian parents and fathers across ethnicities were significantly more likely to experience mental health difficulties, once all other predictors were accounted for. These contributing factors should be considered for future pandemics, where restrictions on people's lives are put in place, and speak to the importance of reducing financial insecurity and food insecurity as a means of improving the mental health of parents.

Socioeconomic deprivation is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We have previously shown that precariousness was more frequent in symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients than in the general population. According to a previous study, coronary artery disease (CAD) patients have a higher level of education than CAD with PAD, but no study directly compared the level of precariousness in PAD and CAD patients. Aim: To measure and compare the level of socioeconomic insecurity in patients suffering from symptomatic PAD with those suffering from isolated CAD, i.e without symptomatic PAD. Methods: We conducted an observational, cohort, prospective, multicenter study. Patients suffering from symptomatic PAD or CAD were recruited through the medical or surgical vascular or cardiology departments, or the vascular rehabilitation center. The EPICES score and the INSEE parameters were used for analysis. The individual is considered precarious when his or her score is greater than or equal to 30. Cardiovascular risk factors and peripheral arterial disease stages were also collected. Results: In total, 230 patients were included. According to the EPICES score, 47.8% [95%CI, 38.7–56.7] of patients with symptomatic PAD were in a precarious situation compared to 17.4% [95%CI, 10.5–24.3] of patients suffering from isolated CAD (P < 0.001). The mean EPICES score was 33.3 (SD 22.5) in the PAD and 16.9 (SD 17.02) in the CAD population, respectively (P < 0.001). In the PAD population, the level of education was low, with an under-representation of patients with a baccalaureate or higher education degree: 21.7% [95%CI, 14.2–29.3] vs. 41.7% [95%CI, 32.7–50.7] in the PAD and CAD populations, respectively. There was also an under-representation of executives and intellectual and intermediate professions in the PAD population, 18.3% [95%CI, 11.2–25.3], compared to the CAD population, 31.3% [95%CI, 22.8–39.8]. Conclusion: PAD patients are more precarious than patients suffering from CAD. A better detection of socioeconomic deprivation in patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease could allow comprehensive care and thus hope for an improvement in terms of morbidity and mortality. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","Cardiovascular risk factors; Coronary heart disease; EPICES score; Peripheral arterial disease; Socioeconomic deprivation","Coronary Artery Disease; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; adult; aged; Article; cardiac patient; cardiology; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cardiovascular risk factor; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; coronary artery disease; disease classification; educational status; emotion assessment; Evaluation of Deprivation and Inequalities in Health Examination Center score; female; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; observational study; peripheral occlusive artery disease; population research; prospective study; social isolation; social problem; social status; socioeconomic insecurity; socioeconomics; tertiary education; undergraduate education; clinical trial; coronary artery disease; multicenter study; peripheral occlusive artery disease; risk factor","G.

The pandemic also impacts on agricultural sector especially on food production, distribution, consumption, and potential for a food crisis. The agricultural sector is the last sector that can withstand any shock. This paper aims to bring information impacts the Covid-19 outbreak has on the agricultural sector, and propose strategies and action for the Indonesia Government in maintaining the stability of the agricultural sector during and after Covid-19. This study uses a qualitative descriptive analysis by describing the phenomena that occurred in the agricultural sector as an impact of Covid-19. The increasing spread of the Covid-19 outbreak has led to a decline in the performance of the agricultural sector. Covid-19 pandemic has an impact on reducing production by 5% due to distraction on the distribution but at the same time, food needs have increased by 5% due to panic buying and decreased import by 5% due to limiting exports. In addition, it also affects the food supply chain, and the threat of food insecurity due to the spread of Covid-19 to villages that are food producers and an increase in unemployment. Therefore Reorienting policy and programs in agriculture and ensuring availability of facilities and assistance for stability stock and the price is required. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","","","Y.

Concurrent validity with the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) was assessed using logistic regression with cohort MDAT score quartiles, linear regression for unit-increase in raw scores and a Generalised Estimating Equation approach (to adjust for clusters) to compare MDAT scores of those with and without functional difficulty. A 3-step, cluster-adjusted multivariable regression model was then carried out to examine risk factors for functional difficulty. Findings Functional Difficulty prevalence was 4.2% (95%CI: 3.2%, 5.2%) in HIV-unexposed children (n = 1606) versus 6.1% (95%CI: 3.5%, 8.9%) in HIV-exposed children (n = 314) (absolute difference 1.9%, 95%CI: -0.93%, 4.69%; p = 0.14). Functional difficulty score correlated negatively with MDAT: for each unit increase in WGCFM score, children completed 2.6 (95%CI: 2.2, 3.1) fewer MDAT items (p = 0.001). Children from families with food insecurity and poorer housing were more at risk of functional difficulty. Interpretation Functional difficulty was identified in approximately 1-in-20 children in rural Zimbabwe, which is comparable to prevalence in previous studies. WGCFM showed concurrent validity with the MDAT, supporting its use in early childhood.  © 2022 Dunne et al.

FI is associated with increased risk for multiple chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health. We selected these four chronic diseases given their global prevalence and comorbid associations with each other. We evaluated the most recent literature published over the past 5 years and offer strategies for the screening of FI. Recent Findings: Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses report an association between FI and obesity in adult women as well as adult men and women living in low- and middle-income countries. Gender differences also were observed between FI and type 2 diabetes, such that adult women showed an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. This association was influenced by social determinants of health. Very low food security (i.e., high FI) was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and a higher risk for cardiovascular disease mortality. Finally, several studies showed an association between FI and adverse mental health outcomes, including increased risk for stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and suicidal ideation. Summary: FI and its negative association with body weight, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health provide a compelling rationale for identification of FI in clinical settings. Brief, well-validated screening measures are available in multiple languages. Despite the need for FI screening, many guidelines do not address its implementation. For this reason, more research and targeted interventions are needed to increase FI screening rates and close the loop in the coordination of resources. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cardiovascular disease; Food insecurity; Mental health; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes","adult; anxiety; body weight; cardiovascular disease; depression; female; food insecurity; human; low income country; mental health; middle income country; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physiological stress; Review; sleep disorder; social determinants of health; suicidal ideation; systematic review","E.A.

Soil salinity is often due to water accumulation in fields caused by improper flood irrigation whereby plants take up the water leaving salts behind. It is, however, the subsurface soil salinity that affects plant growth. This soil salinity prevents further water intake. There have been very few studies conducted for subsurface soil salinity estimation. Therefore our study aimed to estimate subsurface soil salinity (at 60 cm depth) for the early stage of wheat crop growth in a simplified manner using freely available satellite data, which is a novel feature and prime objective in this study. The study utilises SENTINEL-1 SAR (synthetic aperture RADAR) data for backscatter coefficient generation, SENTINEL-2A multispectral data for NDSI (normalised differential salinity index) generation and on-ground equipment for direct collection of soil electrical conductivity (EC). The data were collected for two dates in November and December 2019 and one date in January 2020 during the early stage of wheat crop growth. The dates were selected keeping in mind the satellite pass over the study area of Rupnagar on the same day. Ordinary least squares regression was used for modelling which gave R2-statistics of 0.99 and 0.958 in the training and testing phase and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.92 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.78 in modelling for soil salinity estimation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","backscatter; NDSI; remote sensing; soil salinity; subsurface salinity","India; Punjab [India]; Rupnagar; Crops; Mean square error; Satellites; Soils; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscatter coefficients; Mean absolute error; Multispectral satellite data; Ordinary least squares regressions; Root mean square errors; SAR(synthetic aperture radar); Soil electrical conductivity; Training and testing; backscatter; crop production; crop yield; electrical conductivity; error analysis; estimation method; growth response; least squares method; remote sensing; salinity; satellite data; Sentinel; soil chemistry; synthetic aperture radar; wheat; Soil testing","R.K.

Vegetables are low-energy, nutrient-dense foods that support health. Needs of populations differ by demographics; as such, there is a need to investigate vegetable intake in pregnant women of lower socioeconomic status (SES). The aim of this scoping review was (1) to describe vegetable intake during pregnancy in servings or grams and compare vegetable intake to recommendations and (2) to explore the relationship between vegetable intake during pregnancy and maternal SES characteristics. Using Arksey and O'Malley's framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews, studies were identified in a search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Global Health, and Scopus) published up to July 2021. All observational studies assessing vegetable intake in pregnancy, written in English, and conducted in an energy-replete context worldwide were included for review. Forty-seven publications met inclusion criteria. Although vegetable intake of pregnant women varies across populations, vegetable intake falls below recommendations worldwide. Studies investigating older age (n =9), higher education (n =7), higher income (n =4), and vegetable intake consistently found a positive association, whereas a negative association with food insecurity (n =4) was identified. Other variables explored that may influence vegetable intake was limited and too fragmented to generalize. Inconsistencies and possible inaccuracies in reporting vegetable intake may be related to the considerable variation in tools used for assessing vegetable intake. In conclusion, low vegetable intake in pregnancy needs to be addressed, with a particular focus on women of lower SES because of greater vulnerability to low vegetable intake. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Dietary intake; Guidelines; Maternal; Nutritional intake; Pregnancy; Vegetable","Diet, Healthy; Eating; Family; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Social Class; Vegetables; adult; aged; dietary intake; educational status; female; food insecurity; global health; human; human experiment; Medline; observational study; practice guideline; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; pregnancy; pregnant woman; review; Scopus; social status; systematic review; tertiary education; vegetable; vegetable consumption; vulnerability; Web of Science; eating; family; pregnancy; social class","J.

However, little is known about underlying psychological mechanisms that maintain excessive use of technology. We investigated the mediating role of self-esteem, novelty seeking, and persistence on the relationship between attachment dimensions and technology addiction among young adults. Data were collected from 727 young adults (females, N = 478; 66.3 percent), aged 23.44 ± 3.02 years. Participants completed self-report measures of secure and insecure attachment dimensions, personality, and temperament characteristics (i.e., self-esteem, novelty seeking, and persistence), technology addiction and frequency of technology use (i.e., own technology use, perceived use by peers and parents). The mediation model was tested through a path analysis. The effects of attachment insecurity on technology addiction were partially mediated by the levels of persistence and self-esteem, whereas the effects of attachment security on technology addiction were fully mediated. The effects remained robust even after controlling for the frequency of technology use. The model was gender and age invariant, suggesting that the mediation worked in a similar way for both men and women and across ages. Findings suggest that attachment dimensions exert not only a direct but also an indirect effect on technology addiction through self-esteem and persistence. Such findings may help to develop psychosocial interventions that are sensitive to young adults' attachment, personality, and temperament characteristics.  © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.","attachment; frequency of technology use; personality; technology addiction; temperament","Female; Humans; Male; Peer Group; Self Concept; Self Report; Technology Addiction; Temperament; Young Adult; female; human; male; peer group; self concept; self report; temperament; young adult","C.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, stay-at-home orders and efforts to limit contact with others can affect water access for those with unreliable home water supplies. We explored whether water service delivery and household water-use behaviors changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hubballi–Dharwad, India, and whether they differed if households had IWS or continuous (24×7) water supply through a longitudinal household survey in 2020–2021. We found few perceived differences in water service delivery or water access, although one-quarter of all households reported insufficient water for handwashing, suggesting an increased demand for water that was not satisfied. Many households with 24×7 supply reported water outages, necessitating the use of alternative water sources. These findings suggest that water demand at home increased and households with IWS and 24×7 both lacked access to sufficient water. Our findings indicate that water insecurity negatively affected households’ ability to adhere to protective public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of access to uninterrupted, on-premise water during public health emergencies. © 2022 The Authors","COVID-19 pandemic; drinking water; handwashing; intermittent water supply; piped water; water access","COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Water Quality; Water Supply; Dharwad; India; Karnataka; drinking water; hand sanitizer; COVID-19; household income; household survey; perception; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; water demand; water use; adult; agriculture; Article; behavior change; child; child health; coronavirus disease 2019; female; hand washing; household; human; India; lockdown; lowest income group; major clinical study; male; pandemic; public health; sanitation; social distance; social distancing; socioeconomics; stay-at-home order; virus transmission; waste disposal; water insecurity; water quality; water supply; pandemic; water supply","E.

However, urban water conservation initiatives cannot be successful unless households involve in residential WCBs voluntarily by adopting water curtailment and/or water-efficiency actions. Thus, understanding motivations and mechanisms underlying accepting these two types of WCBs and interpreting their distinctions are primary policy considerations to make sustainable water consumption behaviors. Hence, the purpose of this research was twofold: (1) To explore intentions to household adoption of water curtailment and water-efficiency actions, key corresponding determinants, and distinctions between them; and (2) To evaluate the capability and robustness of the Health Belief Model (HBM) to explain residential WCBs.

The outcomes from structural equation modeling indicated that: (1) Water curtailment intention was solely determined by self-efficacy and perceived benefits; (2) In addition to self-efficacy and perceived benefits, perceived severity, cues to action, and perceived barriers were significantly related to water-efficiency intention; (3) While only perceived susceptibility was not a significant determinant for water-efficiency intention, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers, and cues to action could not significantly explain water curtailment intention; (4) Self-efficacy also emerged as the strongest predictive variable behind intentions to adopt both WCBs; (5) The perceived barriers had a negative significant relationship only with water-efficiency intention; and (6) The HBM could explain 72% and 61% of the variance in households’ intentions to adopt water curtailment and water-efficiency actions, respectively. These outcomes supported that the HBM could propose a reliable and practical heuristic theoretical framework to predict residential WCBs. Moreover, the findings confirmed significant differences among socio-psychological factors behind intentions to household adoption of both WCBs, which need to be addressed. The research results introduced numerous implications from theoretical and policy standpoints for improving residential WCBs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Health belief model; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable water consumption behavior; Water curtailment actions; Water security; Water-efficiency actions","Conservation of Water Resources; Cross-Sectional Studies; Intention; Iran; Policy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Water; Water Supply; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Iran]; water; action plan; cross section; demand analysis; design; household survey; livelihood; perception; research work; sustainability; water demand; water management; water planning; water stress; water use; adaptive behavior; Article; behavior change; conceptual framework; construct validity; controlled study; convergent validity; discriminant validity; environmental policy; environmental psychology; face validity; fluid intake; Health Belief Model; human; internal consistency; methodology; preventive medicine; pro-environmental behavior; questionnaire; renewable energy; residential area; self concept; Social Cognitive Theory; social psychology; structural equation modeling; structural model; urban area; water conservation; water insecurity; water management; behavior; cross-sectional study; Iran; policy; water supply","M.

The four pillars of food security (availability, access, use and stability) are in danger due to the impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors which impact on the food system. Novel foods, like seaweeds, have the potential to increase food yields so that to contribute in preventing or avoiding future global food shortages. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess microbiological, chemical, physical, and allergenic risks associated with seaweed consumption. Four research strings have been used to search for these risks. Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were applied. Finally, 39 articles met the selected criteria. No significant hazards for microbiological, allergenic, and physical risks were detected. Regarding chemical risk, algae can accumulate various heavy metals, especially when harvested in polluted sites. Cultivating sea-weeds in a controlled environment allows to avoid this risk. Periodic checks will be necessary on the finished products to monitor heavy metals levels. Since the consumption of algae seems to be on the rise everywhere, it seems to be urgent that food control authorities establish the safety levels to which eating algae does not represent any risk for human health. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, the study and genomic surveillance of bacterial carriers of resistance in and outside of clinical settings is of utter importance. A colony of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria identified as Klebsiella spp., by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, has been isolated from an urban lake in Brazil, during a drug-degrading bacterial prospection. Genomic analyses revealed the bacteria as Klebsiella pneumoniae species. Furthermore, the in silico Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) identified the genome as a new sequence type, ST5236. The search for antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) detected the presence of genes against beta-lactams, fosfomycin, acriflavine and efflux pumps, as well as genes for heavy metal resistance. Of particular note, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene (blaCTX-M-15) has been detected in close proximity to siphoviridae genes, while a carbapenemase gene (KPC-2) has been found in an extrachromosomal contig, within a novel non-Tn4401 genetic element (NTEKPC). An extrachromosomal contig found in the V3 isolate is identical to a contig of a K. pneumoniae isolate from a nearby hospital, which indicates a putative gene flow from the hospital network into Paranoá lake. The discovery of a MDR isolate in this lake is worrisome, as the region has recently undergone periods of water scarcity causing the lake, which receives treated wastewater effluent, and is already used for recreational purposes, to be used as an environmental buffer for drinking water reuse. Altogether, our results indicate an underrepresentation of environmental K. pneumoniae among available genomes, which may hamper the understanding of the population dynamics of the species in the environment and its consequences in the spread of ARGs and virulence genes.

However, water security has been conceptualized under different perspectives, including various aspects and dimensions. Since public health is also an integral part of water security, it is necessary to understand how health has been incorporated as a dimension in the existing water security frameworks. While supply–demand and governance narratives dominated several popular water security frameworks, studies that are specifically designed for public health purposes are generally lacking. This research aims to address this gap, firstly by assessing the multiple thematic dimensions of water security frameworks in scientific disclosure; and secondly by looking into the public health dimensions and evaluating their importance and integration in the existing water security frameworks. For this, a systematic review of the Scopus database was undertaken using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A detailed review analysis of 77 relevant papers was performed. The result shows that 11 distinct dimensions have been used to design the existing water security framework. Although public health aspects were mentioned in 51% of the papers, direct health impacts were considered only by 18%, and indirect health impacts or mediators were considered by 33% of the papers. Among direct health impacts, diarrhea is the most prevalent one considered for developing a water security framework. Among different indirect or mediating factors, poor accessibility and availability of water resources in terms of time and distance is a big determinant for causing mental illnesses, such as stress or anxiety, which are being considered when framing water security framework, particularly in developing nations. Water quantity is more of a common issue for both developed and developing countries, water quality and mismanagement of water supply-related infrastructure is the main concern for developing nations, which proved to be the biggest hurdle for achieving water security. It is also necessary to consider how people treat and consume the water available to them. The result of this study sheds light on existing gaps for different water security frameworks and provides policy-relevant guidelines for its betterment. Also, it stressed that a more wide and holistic approach must be considered when framing a water security framework to result in sustainable water management and human well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

However, little is known about the correlates of multiple suicide attempts in adolescents, especially from a global perspective. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association of putative physical, behavioral, and social correlates with multiple suicide attempts among adolescents aged 12–15 years from 61 countries. Data from the Global school-based Student Health Survey (2009–2017) were analyzed. Multiple suicide attempts was classified as having attempted suicide at least twice in the past 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the potential correlates. Data on 162,994 adolescents [mean (SD) age 13.8 (0.9) years; 50.8% boys] were analyzed. The overall prevalence of multiple suicide attempts was 4.4% [range 1.2% (Laos) to 13.8% (Ghana)]. Among those who had attempted suicide at least once in the past 12 months, in the overall sample, food insecurity, smoking, alcohol consumption, cannabis use, amphetamine use, sedentary behavior, sexual intercourse, sleep problems, loneliness, no close friends, and bullying victimization were all independently associated with higher odds for multiple suicide attempts although some regional differences were observed. Our study results indicate potential target factors that could be addressed amongst those who had attempted suicide in the past to reduce future suicide attempts and possibly completed suicides. Furthermore, it is possible that region-specific interventions are necessary. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescents; Correlates; Epidemiology; Multi-country study; Multiple suicide attempts; Repeated suicide attempts","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Asia; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Young Adult; adolescent; Africa; alcohol consumption; amphetamine abuse; Article; Asia; behavior; bullying; cannabis use; child; female; food insecurity; health survey; human; loneliness; male; prevalence; public health; school child; sedentary lifestyle; sexual intercourse; sleep disorder; smoking; social aspect; Southern Europe; suicide; suicide attempt; Western Hemisphere; adolescent behavior; adult; cross-sectional study; suicidal ideation; young adult","L.

This chapter analyses the lifting of the hunting ban and the elephant debate in Botswana. It further analyses its implications to conservation and development in Southern Africa. This analysis is informed by the socio-ecological theory and draws from qualitative fieldwork, before and after the hunting ban. This includes a series of key informant interviews, review of government and community-based organisations’ materials, sustained engagement with domestic and international media reports and social media content (Facebook and Twitter). Data on trophy hunting, human-wildlife interactions and wildlife conservation were collected. The reintroduction of hunting in 2019 in Botswana sparked an international outcry, especially from citizens of the Global North. The ever-increasing elephant population in Botswana has caused economic and social and food insecurity for citizens of Botswana. Despite differences between the Global North and South, trophy hunting provides incentives for wildlife conservation and rural communities’ development. Trade bans by some Western countries and trade restrictions by CITES also affect local economies in the Global South. In conclusion, any policy shifts that affect wildlife conservation and rural livelihoods need to be informed by a socio-ecological approach. This participatory and scientific approach to decision-making has the potential to contribute to sustainable livelihoods and wildlife conservation in Botswana and southern Africa. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Lesego Senyana Stone, Moren Tibabo Stone, Patricia Kefilwe Mogomotsi and Goemeone E.J.

An increasing unemployment rate has led to a surge in the sense of job insecurity among employees. Lack of job security has a direct impact on an employee’s health and work–life balance. This article focusses on the relationship between and impact of job insecurity on work–life balance, that is, to understand the impact of perceived job insecurity on working hours, employee’s health and reduced family time. Using a self-completed questionnaire, data was collected from 413 employees from different sectors like construction, banks, hospitals, hotels, schools, FMCG, telecommunication, etc., in India, which assisted in testing five hypotheses. The study found a positive relationship between job insecurity and health issues and work–life conflict. Additionally, job insecurity was negatively linked with job performance. Regression analysis showed mediating effects of work demand, work time, family time and family demand on the relationship of job insecurity with health issues, job performance and work–life conflict.

Geopoliticisation of the COVID-19 vaccines have not been explored so far. Based on the qualitative analysis of the media content and statis-tics on the vaccines’ distribution, this article makes two arguments. First, these vaccines have become an extension of foreign policy by other means. Second, geopoliticisation of the distribution of vaccine contributes to an instrumentalisation of the pandemic, raising global insecurity and the destabilisation of states and economies on the periphery and semi-periphery. Due to this new Cold War between the ‘vaccine superpowers’, the world has become divided into Western and the Eastern ‘vaccine-blocs’. Within this context, the chances for multilateral cooperation to counter global threats are on a downward trajectory. © Belgrade Centre for Security Policy.","geopolitical tool; geopolitics of vaccines; Serbia; vaccine diplomacy; vaccine superpowers","","","","Belgrade Centre for Security Policy","2217995X","","","","English","J.

Mycotoxins, including aflatoxins (AFs), fumonisins (FBs), trichothecenes, and zearalenone (ZEN), are common contaminants of poultry feeds and feed ingredients from SSA. These mycotoxins cause deleterious effects on the health and productivity of chickens and can also be present in poultry food products, thereby posing a health hazard to human consumers of these products. This review summarizes studies of major mycotoxins in poultry feeds, feed ingredients, and poultry food products from SSA as well as aflatoxicosis outbreaks. Additionally reviewed are the worldwide regulation of mycotoxins in poultry feeds, the impact of major mycotoxins in the production of chickens, and the postharvest use of mycotoxin detoxifiers. In most studies, AFs are most commonly quantified, and levels above the European Union regulatory limits of 20 µg/kg are reported. Trichothecenes, FBs, ZEN, and OTA are also reported but are less frequently analyzed. Co-occurrences of mycotoxins, especially AFs and FBs, are reported in some studies. The effects of AFs on chickens’ health and productivity, carryover to their products, as well as use of mycotoxin binders are reported in few studies conducted in SSA. More research should therefore be conducted in SSA to evaluate occurrences, toxicological effects, and mitigation strategies to prevent the toxic effects of mycotoxins. © 2021 by the authors.

The methodology of analysis is a comparative law research approach. The key findings of this article are that major improvements have been made in strengthening institutional capacity and ensuring the satisfaction of victims’ rights in these processes. However, physical and legal insecurity still present major risks to ex-combatants and, therefore, to the integrity and success of the peace process.

As insulin demand and prices rise dramatically, insulin affordability has increasingly become an issue facing patients with diabetes worldwide. To cut insulin costs, many patients ration their supply, which may have dire health consequences. This particularly affects lower-income populations, who are often forced to choose between purchasing their medications or paying for other necessities. Nutrition might be one solution for this. This commentary aims to provide comprehensive insight with historical context into intersectional components of diabetes in the global arena through analyses of insulin affordability, coupled with the critical role of nutrition intervention after searching the PubMed for relevant articles. More studies in personalized nutrition, supplementations, and dietary behaviors may develop evidence-based nutrition interventions to control diabetes. We argue that alongside price regulation, a greater focus to nutrition to address issues of food insecurity and food assistance programs may help to improve insulin affordability. © 2022, The Author(s).","Diabetes; Food insecurity; Global health; Insulin affordability; Insulin price; Nutrition intervention","Costs and Cost Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus; Food Assistance; Humans; Insulin; Insulin, Regular, Human; human insulin; insulin; cost; diabetes mellitus; food assistance; human","G.

This study examines individuals' perceptions of water's uniqueness in order to explore how these relate to (self-reported) conservation behaviors. The results of an online survey (n = 1013) in a Western European country showed that perceptions of water as a natural resource with unique assets positively influenced the value individuals attach to water and increased their concerns related to its scarcity. Both of these mediating variables (perceived water value and water scarcity concerns) strengthen individuals' moral obligations to conserve water, which appears to be an important mediating variable with regard to the positive impact perceived water uniqueness has on conservation behavior. People's perceptions of water's uniqueness are influenced by attributes focusing on its aesthetics and pureness, the hedonic (experiential) dimension of water, and, to a lesser extent, its naturalness. The utilitarian dimension of water does not predict the level of perceived uniqueness, and perceptions of water availability relate negatively to the perceived uniqueness of water. In particular, older females and respondents with a lower education level perceived the uniqueness of water to be high. The results of this study provide guidelines on how policy makers can promote water conservation by focusing on the meaning individuals attribute to water as a long-term behavioral change strategy. When individuals approach water as a commodity, the urge to conserve water is likely to stay low. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Commodity theory; Meaningful water value; Moral obligation; Scarcity concerns; Sustainable water consumption","Conservation of Natural Resources; Conservation of Water Resources; Europe; Female; Humans; Moral Obligations; Perception; Water; Western Europe; water; water; commodity; conservation management; human behavior; natural resource; perception; policy making; water management; water planning; adult; aged; Article; behavior; behavior change; educational status; environmental policy; female; health care survey; human; male; morality; natural resource; online analysis; practice guideline; quantitative study; self report; sex difference; water availability; water conservation; water insecurity; water management; Western Europe; environmental protection; Europe; perception","V.

In this study, we conceptualized a framework capturing recurring troublesome elements of mental states such as depression and general anxiety, assessing them by applying standard clinical inventory. The study explores the extent to which danger control and fear control under the Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM) threat impact job insecurity, with uncertainty phenomenon causing afflicting effect on the experiential nature of depression heightened by anxiety. With the aim to explore the job insecurity relationship with anxiety and depression, and measure the impact of EPPM threat, an empirical study was conducted in the United States on a sample of 347 white collar employees. Demographic data, EPPM threat, job insecurity, anxiety, and depression data were collected via a standardized questionnaire during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The questionnaire consisting of multi-item scales was distributed online. All the scale items were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale. SEM software AMOS version 23 was used to perform confirmatory factor analysis with maximum likelihood estimation. In the structural model, relationships between the threat of COVID-19, job insecurity, anxiety, and depression were assessed. The findings of the study suggest that job insecurity has a significant impact on depression and anxiety, whereas the threat of COVID-19 has a significant impact on depression. Mediating effects of job insecurity and EPPM threat impact on anxiety were not established in the study. The study contributes to the apprehension of the repercussions of major environmental disruptions on normal human functioning, and it investigates the effects of self-reported protective behaviors on risk perception. The study also explains the underlying mechanisms of coping behavior as possible antecedents to mental disorders. When subjected to stressful events, heightened psychological arousal causes physical and psychological challenges of affected employees to manifest as behavioral issues. © Copyright © 2021 Obrenovic, Du, Godinic, Baslom and Tsoy.","anxiety; COVID-19; depression; EPPM model; EPPM threat; job insecurity; mood disorders","","B.

These organizations exist in most low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) worldwide under various names. A comprehensive search of scholarly outputs across six electronic databases (Pub-Med, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost, Scopus, Sabinet, and Cochrane) from 2000 to 2021 was completed. Twenty-eight (28) records met our inclusion criteria, and their quality was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) qualitative checklist. We identified through thematic analysis that ROSCAs/ASCAs play a crucial role in advancing social, economic, and health transformations, especially among women in urban SSA. However, while ROSCAs/ACSAs played important roles in food security, it was often not the primary motivation for participation. None of the selected studies identified the importance of dietary quality or access to healthy food in relation to food security. This review suggests a window of opportunity to promote partnerships and collaborations of ROSCAs/ASCAs with relevant stakeholders to leverage the functionalities of ROSCAs/ASCAs as vehicles for re-alignment of priorities, increased knowledge, and opportunities to encourage affordable healthy diets in urban SSA. © 2022 by the authors.

Data about perceived FI and its risk factors in Mexican university students are lacking. We aimed to assess FI’s prevalence and factors affecting it among university students’ households in Mexico. This cross-sectional analysis involved 7671 university students’ households using the 2018 Mexican National of Household Income and Expenditure Survey data. Variables analyzed included sociodemographic characteristics, and the 12-item validated Mexican Scale for Food Security (EMSA). Multivariable logistic regression modelling was performed to identify FI risk factors. The overall household FI prevalence was 30.8%. According to FI severity, prevalence rates were 16.3% for mild-FI, 8.8% for moderate-FI, and 5.7% for severe-FI. Low socioeconomic status (OR = 2.72; 95%CI: 2.09–3.54), low education level of household’s head (OR = 2.36; 95%CI: 1.90–2.94), self-ascription to an indigenous group (OR = 1.59; 95%CI: 1.41–1.79), attending public university (OR = 1.27; 95%CI: 1.13–1.43), female-headed household (OR = 1.26; 95%CI: 1.13–1.40), having worked recently (OR = 1.19; 95%CI: 1.07–1.33), and being in second year of studies (OR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.03–1.33), were significantly related to FI. Our results confirm that FI is highly prevalent among Mexican university students’ households and that sociodemographic factors are essential in addressing this concern. Findings highlight the need for preventive programs and policies to alleviate FI. © 2021 by the authors.

We conducted this systematic review to summarize and evaluate the dietary intake and nutritional status among refugees resettled in non-camp settings worldwide. We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases to review relevant studies published between 2009 and 2020 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We also conducted an additional manual search through PubMed and Google Scholar. Studies that evaluated both dietary intake and nutritional status of refugees in host countries were included. A total of 15 articles from 10 countries were included and assessed for study quality and outcomes. Poor dietary diversity and insufficient intake of specific food groups were reported. In addition to these dietary patterns, a high prevalence of stunting, underweight, and anemia was reported, particularly among children. A double burden of malnutrition was also observed across and within studies. Post-resettlement dietary intake and nutritional status of refugees are both influenced by factors at the pre- and post-resettlement stages as refugees transition to their host countries. Those factors, including pre-resettlement experiences, host country resources, socioeconomic status, acculturation, and food security, were summarized and presented in a conceptual model. There is a need for comprehensive dietary and health screening as well as culturally appropriate and sustainable nutrition education resources and interventions for refugees to improve their diet and nutrition. Longitudinal studies and novel methodological approaches are also suggested to measure changes in refugees' food intake and nutritional status as well as to further investigate factors associated with these 2 components. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) have faced particular challenges: being exposed to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and caring for patients having a new and potentially life-threatening disease. The aim of this study was to explore how HCWs in the Swedish healthcare system perceived their work situation during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Methods: Focus group discussions and interviews with HCWs were performed from June to October 2020 in one Swedish healthcare region. A purposeful sampling approach was used to select a variety of professions (physicians, nurses, nurse aides and cleaners) and workplaces (hospital inpatient wards, emergency department, nursing home and home care service). Qualitative content analysis was used for data analysis. Results: In total, 51 HCWs participated in eight focus group discussions and one HCW participated in an individual interview. The content analysis identified two main categories: ‘Concerns about the risk of infection and transmission of infection to others’, and ‘Transition from chaos to managing in a new and challenging work situation’. The findings revealed how HCWs perceived working conditions, including experiences of fear for personal health, confusion and uncertainty regarding personal protective equipment and infection prevention and control (PPE/IPC), and fear of infecting others. Both fearful and appreciating attitudes were achieved from the surrounding community. Helpful strategies for transition from chaos to control were lifted i.e. present and supportive leadership, and finding comfort and strength in the working team. Both helplessness and meaningfulness were described when caring for COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: This study provides unique insights into HCWs experiences of an extremely challenging work situation during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, including feelings of stress and insecurity in a chaotic and hazardous working environment. But there is also mitigation of these challenges and even positive experiences including feelings of safety and meaningfulness. To enhance safety among HCWs in healthcare crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings highlight the importance of avoiding confusion about PPE/IPC, having a supportive healthcare leadership and ensuring accurate information provision about virus transmission to the public. © 2021, The Author(s).","Coronavirus disease 2019; Health personnel; Infection control; Mental health; Occupational health; Patient care; Qualitative research","COVID-19; Focus Groups; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; health care personnel; human; information processing; pandemic","C.

The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a deep economic crisis, exacerbating worldwide feelings of uncertainty and precarity. Individuals with insecure jobs have (and will) probably suffered the most from this situation. Workers with higher job insecurity have poorer psychological and physical health, display more negative work attitudes and are less satisfied about their life. However, much less is known about the impact of job insecurity and life uncertainty on consumer behavior. Using the Conservation of Resources theory as a framework, the present study examines a model in which job insecurity and life uncertainty would have a negative effect on everyday consumptions and broader life projects of individuals. Data collection was conducted in Italy in June and July 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, in the immediate aftermath of the national lockdown. In a sample of 830 workers, the results of a mediation analysis showed that job insecurity and life uncertainty had a detrimental impact of consumer behaviors, since they were significantly associated with higher propensity to sacrifice and reduce everyday short-term consumptions (e.g., buying food) and greater perceived unaffordability of broader long-term life projects (e.g., buying a house). © 2021 by the authors.

A flexible global food system, and one of the critical routes to achieving better FNS, requires the reorganization of relevant policies. Among them, policies and strategies related to the creation and adaptation of technologies, innovations, and their associated institutional adjustments are significant factors to counteract the complex and growing challenges of the global food system. During the last decades, food and nutritional security (FNS) has developed greatly in practice. This overview provides some basic information about current understanding on agriculture, food, and nutritional security. It introduces the concepts of food and nutritional security and separately introduces the part of this book. It focuses on the overview of agriculture, food, and nutritional security worldwide, followed by a more detailed analysis along various dimensions of food security, such as food availability, food utilization, and sustainability in food supplies and access to food. This observation emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of food insecurity concerns, which have to be addressed through an effective cross-sectoral approach. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Developing countries and agriculture; Food and nutritional security","","","","Springer International Publishing","","978-303069333-6; 978-303069332-9","","","English","agric., Food and nutr. secur.: A Study of availab. and sustain. in India","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150402957"

The literature indicates higher rates of FI for women than men in some regions of the world. Thus, the main objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess differences in experiencing FI according to gender in Central-Eastern Europe—a region that has been little researched in terms of FI. The study analyzes individual-level data on FI from the Gallup World Poll (GWP) for the years 2018–2019, obtained under a license from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Dataset encompasses representative samples of individuals aged 15 and above for each studied country. Apart from bivariate analysis, the ordered logistic regression, the generalized ordered logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression models were used. It was found that women experienced mild FI more often than men. However, gender differences with respect to moderate or severe FI were not confirmed. Moreover, the significant associations of all severity levels of FI with education, employment status, social capital, social network, age, marital status, household composition and income were observed.

As in other disciplines, marine early-career researchers (ECRs) are essential contributors to the development of novel and innovative science. Based on a survey of 322 of our peers, we show that the pandemic negatively impacted marine ECRs in ways that further exacerbate existing structural challenges such as social isolation, job insecurity, and short-term contracts, competitive funding, and work pressure. Furthermore, we find that the success and wellbeing of marine ECRs depends heavily on networking opportunities, gaining practical experience, collecting data, and producing publications, all of which were disrupted by the pandemic. Our analysis shows that those in the earliest stages of their careers feel most vulnerable to long-term career disadvantage as a result of the pandemic. This paper contributes to the empirical body of work about the impacts of the pandemic on marine science and offers recommendations on how marine ECRs should be supported to achieve the UN Ocean Decade’s goal of producing “the science we need for the ocean we want”. © The Author(s) 2022.","early career scientists; institutional responses; intersectional; marine science; reflexive science; SARS-CoV-2; UN Ocean Decade","COVID-19; innovation; institutional framework; severe acute respiratory syndrome; United Nations","A.

Different environmental factors have been evaluated in the etiology. In the present study, we investigated the role of attachment examining whether insecure attachment to carers or carers' own attachment insecurity was related to a higher risk of T1D in children. Methods: We included 101 children with T1D (mean age 11.8 years), 106 healthy controls (11.6 years), and one of their carers. We assessed children's attachment using the Child Attachment Interview and carers' attachment using the Relationship Structures Questionnaire. We constructed binary multinomial logistic regression models using attachment to mothers, carers' attachment representations, and stressful life-events as T1D predictors. Results: Higher carer attachment anxiety was associated with the child's T1D diagnosis (p < 0.05; R2 = 0.0613) while security of attachment to mothers showed no significant association. When mothers' education was included in the model, both attachment anxiety in higher educated mothers and stressful life events showed a significant association with the child's T1D (p < 0.001; R2 = 0.293). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that higher attachment-related anxiety in carers with high education and stressful life events are associated with T1D in children. © Copyright © 2021 Turin, Dovč, Klemenčič, Bratina, Battelino, Lipovšek, Uršič, Shmueli-Goetz and Drobnič-Radobuljac.","attachment—a strong affectional bond; child/adolescent; etiology; stress; stressful life events; type 1 diabetes mellitus","adolescent; adult; anxiety; Article; behavior; caregiver; case control study; child; childhood; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; distress syndrome; DSM-5; education; female; hearing impairment; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; intellectual impairment; interview; life event; major clinical study; male; mother; observational study; physiological stress; posttraumatic stress disorder; questionnaire; risk assessment; security; social status; tertiary education; work environment","M.

With this, photocatalysis and photocatalytic ozonation are strong solutions to obtain good quality reclaimed water, for different applications. Nanostructured supported photo-active catalysts, such as the TiO2, WO3 or ZnO can positively affect the performance of such technologies. Therefore, different semiconductors materials have been aroused the interest of the scientific community, mainly due to its functional properties as well as characteristics imposed by the different nanostructures. With this, this work overviews different works and perspective on the TiO2 nanotubes and other semiconductors nanostructures, with the analysis of different works from 2001 to 2022. Aspects as the substrate effect, electrolyte nature, aspect ratio, electrolyte aging, and annealing treatment but also the effect of morphology, anodization time, applied voltage, temperature and viscosity are discussed. Modification of TiO2 nanotubes is also presented in this paper. The main objective of this work is to present and discuss the key parameters and their effects on the anodization of different semiconductors, as well as the results obtained until today on the degradation of different contaminants by photocatalysis and photocatalytic ozonation, as well as their use on the treatment of real wastewater. TiO2 nanotubes present unique properties and highly ordered configuration, which motivate their use on photo-driven technologies for the pollutant's abatement, even when compared to other nanostructures. However, photocatalysts with activity on the visible range and solar radiation, such as the WO3, can present higher performance and can decrease operational costs, and must be an important source and a key to find efficient and cost-friendly solutions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AOPs; CECs; Nanostructures; Supported photocatalysts; Wastewater treatment","Catalysis; Nanostructures; Ozone; Titanium; Waste Water; Water; Aspect ratio; Electrolytes; II-VI semiconductors; Magnetic semiconductors; Morphology; Nanotubes; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Photocatalysis; Titanium dioxide; Wastewater treatment; Wide band gap semiconductors; Zinc oxide; 2 naphthol; 2,3 dichlorophenol; 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acetone; acid orange 7; aflatoxin B1; alachlor; ammonium fluoride; aniline; benzene; benzyl alcohol; bismuth; caffeine; calcium; carbamazepine; carbendazim; catechol; chemical compound; cobalt; copper; cyanide; dichloroacetic acid; diclofenac; diethyltoluamide; electrolyte; erbium; estradiol; estrone; ethinylestradiol; ethyl paraben; ethylene glycol; fluoride; fluorouracil; glyphosate; gold; humic acid; hydrocortisone; hydrofluoric acid; ibuprofen; imazapyr; lanthanum; manganese; methyl orange; methyl paraben; methylene blue; metolachlor; molybdenum; nanochannel; nanomaterial; nanostructured photocatalyst; nanotube; nickel; niobium; ofloxacin; oxalic acid; paracetamol; paraquat; perfluorooctanoic acid; phenol; phosphorus; propiconazole; propyl paraben; rhodamine B; ruthenium; salicylic acid; samarium; silver; sodium fluoride; strontium; sulfamethoxazole; sulfuric acid; tin; titanium dioxide; triclosan; trimethoprim; tungsten trioxide; unclassified drug; vanadium; zinc oxide; ozone; titanium; water; AOP; CEC; Nano-structured; Performance; Photocatalytic ozonation; Supported photocatalyst; TiO 2 nanotube; Water and wastewater; Water scarcity; Waters managements; catalyst; nanoparticle; ozonation; pollutant removal; removal experiment; wastewater treatment; annealing; anodization; anodization time; applied voltage; chemical procedures; electrodeposition; electrolyte aging; incidence of photon conversion efficiency; ozonation; photocatalysis; photocatalytic ozonation; physical parameters; radiation; Review; temperature; ultraviolet radiation; viscosity; waste water management; water contamination; water insecurity; water quality; catalysis; chemistry; wastewater; Tungsten compounds","R.C.

Thus, to foster more just and sustainable agendas in protected areas (PAs), this diversity of perspectives must be better understood, acknowledged, and tackled. In this article, we aimed to initiate this understanding for the Makay region in Madagascar, a poorly-known region where a ‘New Protected Area’ has been gazetted. In combining mental models and social representation theory, we explored different stakeholders’ perspectives about the Makay social-ecological system, and how differences in stakeholders’ viewpoints could challenge the success of an inclusive, just, and sustainable conservation program. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 respondents having different expertise on the Makay. During interviews, respondents were guided towards the elicitation of their individual cognitive map (ICM) of the Makay social-ecological system. ICMs were then analyzed in combining quantitative and qualitative. Respondents described the Makay through a total of 162 components, including 51 components that constituted the central zone of the Makay’s representation. In particular, respondents pointed to insecurity issues caused by zebu thieves, as well as to environmental challenges relative to anthropogenic fires and hunting. On the contrary, they considered mining activities and timber harvesting as more peripheral problems. Through a multivariate clustering analysis, we discriminated two clusters of respondents with contrasting visions about the Makay, ecocentric vs. social-ecological, which was largely influenced by respondents’ background. In comparing the two clusters’ representations, we found that they had dissimilar diagnoses about key socio-environmental challenges in the Makay and how to address them. This ambiguity in respondents’ viewpoints stresses the need to increase research efforts in the Makay region to fill current knowledge gaps about this poorly known social-ecological system, and to foster social learning between stakeholders concerned by the Makay new PA. © 2022 Fromont et al.

This study suggests global implications for nurses working in rural or remote areas, even during a worldwide pandemic. Methods: The participants were 16 Korean community health practitioners who worked in rural or remote locations for over 20 years. This study identified nurses' key retention factors contributing to long service in rural and remote areas. This is a qualitative study based on the narrative method and analysis was conducted using grounded theory. A semi-structured questionnaire was conducted based on the following: the life flow of the participants' first experience, episodes during the work experience, and reflections on the past 20 years. Results: First, personal 'financial needs' and 'callings' were motivation-related causal conditions. The adaptation of environment-work-community was the contextual condition leading to intervening conditions, building coping strategies by encountering a lifetime crisis. The consequences of 'transition' and 'maturation' naturally occurred with chronological changes. The unique factors were related to the 'external changes' in the Korean primary health system, which improved the participants' social status and welfare. Conclusion: Considering multi-dimensional retention factors was critical, including chronological (i.e., historical changes) and external factors (i.e., healthcare systems), to be supportive synchronously for rural nurses. Without this, the individuals working in the rural areas could be victimized by insecurity and self-commitment. Furthermore, considering the global pandemic, the retention of nurses is crucial to prevent the severity of isolation in rural and remote areas © 2022 Korean Academy of Community Health Nursing","Community health nursing; Grounded theory; Qualitative research; Rural nursing","","J.K.

This book explains that Madrassas are religious schools that have existed in many Muslim countries for centuries and contributed significantly to preserving, forming, and extending human knowledge in medieval times. Further, madrassas are now more commonly viewed as the providers of a narrow education, supporting religious fundamentalism, that may lead to terrorism. However, this book asserts that education is not the only function performed by madrassas. They are a significant source of welfare support for the vulnerable and marginalized households in many low-income countries. This book helps the readers to understand the concept of informal social protection not conceptualized previously. In addition, its various attributes and institutions providing such a form of welfare worldwide are explained in detail; analyzing the usefulness of such a form of social protection would benefit readers of social policy, national governments, and international donor/aid agencies. This book also provides a prescriptive framework for integrating formal and informal social protection. This book provides a new ""Multiple Regime Framework"", for identifying various regimes in one country at one point in time by applying a novel data collection and analysis methodology. The application of this framework would be of particular interest to social policy scholars, national governments, and donor/aid agencies because it will result in better targeting of social protection policies in the wake of fiscal constraints. Lastly, this book provides a novel data collection and analysis strategy that will benefit the reader of research methodology, development consultants, donor agencies, and policy practitioners interested in using artificial intelligence to make informed and targeted policy decisions. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.","artificial intelligence; colonisation; DBSCAN clustering; extremism; informal assistance; informal insurance; informal labour market measures; informal security regimes; Informal social protection; insecurity regimes; K-means clustering; labour market interventions; madrasas; multiple regime framework; social assistance; social insurance; Social protection; terrorism; unsupervised machine learning; welfare regimes","","","","Springer Nature","","978-981196474-9; 978-981196473-2","","","English","Informal Soc.

Although reservoirs and dams are criticized for their negative social and environmental impacts by reducing natural flow variability and obstructing river connections, they are also recognized as important for social and economic development and climate change adaptation. Multiple studies map large dams and analyze the dynamics of water stored in the reservoirs behind these dams, but very few studies focus on small and medium-sized reservoirs on a global scale. In this research, we use multi-annual multi-sensor satellite data, combined with cloud analytics, to monitor the state of small (10–100 ha) to medium-sized (> 100 ha, excluding 479 large ones) artificial water reservoirs globally for the first time. These reservoirs are of crucial importance to the well-being of many societies, but regular monitoring records of their water dynamics are mostly missing. We combine the results of multiple studies to identify 71,208 small to medium-sized reservoirs, followed by reconstructing surface water area changes from satellite data using a novel method introduced in this study. The dataset is validated using 768 daily in-situ water level and storage measurements (r2 > 0.7 for 67% of the reservoirs used for the validation) demonstrating that the surface water area dynamics can be used as a proxy for water storage dynamics in many cases. Our analysis shows that for small reservoirs, the inter-annual and intra-annual variability is much higher than for medium-sized reservoirs worldwide. This implies that the communities reliant on small reservoirs are more vulnerable to climate extremes, both short-term (within seasons) and longer-term (across seasons). Our findings show that the long-term inter-annual and intra-annual changes in these reservoirs are not equally distributed geographically. Through several cases, we demonstrate that this technology can help monitor water scarcity conditions and emerging food insecurity, and facilitate transboundary cooperation. It has the potential to provide operational information on conditions in ungauged or upstream riparian countries that do not share such data with neighboring countries. This may help to create a more level playing field in water resource information globally. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Climate Change; Humans; Rivers; Seasons; Water; Water Supply; water; climate change; human; river; season; water supply","G.

This study aimed to estimate the burden of adolescent suicidal behaviours and its association with violence and unintentional injury, psychosocial, protective, lifestyle and food security-related factors amongst school-based adolescents across 77 countries in the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. Methods This study comprised a sample of 251 763 adolescents drawn from the latest Global School-based Student Health Survey of school-based adolescents, aged 11-17 years, across 77 countries. Logistic regression analyses were employed to estimate the adjusted effect of independent factors on adolescent suicidal behaviours. Results The population-weighted 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI), suicidal planning (SP) and suicidal attempts (SA) amongst school-based adolescents was 18, 18 and 16%, respectively. Adolescent suicidal behaviours (i.e. SI, SP and SA) were respectively associated with being physically attacked, physical fighting, high levels of anxiety, feeling lonely, being bullied, lack of parental support, poor peer support, not having close friends and high levels of sedentary behaviours. Overall, these associations also extended to the context of food insecurity across regions and country income groups, where the magnitude of association slightly varied from odds ratios of 1.25 times to 3.13. Conclusions The burden of school-going adolescent suicidal thoughts, suicide planning and suicide attempts is of particular concern in low-resource countries. Comprehensive suicide prevention programmes for school-going adolescents in LMICs are needed that address socio-cultural inequities related to violence and unintentional injury, social support and psychological factors, protective, and lifestyle-related factors.

At the pandemic onset, a dramatic suicides exacerbation was feared. Some authoritative authors warned the scientific and clinical community about this risk by pointing out that especially psychiatric, psychological, and social factors could interact with each other to create a vicious cycle. While worldwide case-reports and studies conducted at emergency departments did indeed find an increase in suicidal behavior, recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and time-series analyses could not confirm this for the first COVID-19 wave. Instead, it appears that the increased suicide risk outlasted the acute phase of the pandemic and thus affected people more during the pandemic following phases. One possible reason for this phenomenon may be a persistent state of insecurity regarding the economic crisis evolution with serious financial stressors in terms of income decrease, unemployment, repaying debts difficulty, home loss, one’s social status derive, social hierarchy drop, and poverty. During the COVID-19 first wave, with particular regard to vulnerable populations, one of the postulated theories unifying different risk factors under a single frame was the “Interpersonal Theory of Suicide”. Conversely, the “Interpersonal Trust” theory emerged as a protective factor even during an economic crisis. In a possible mirroring of the two theories, it seems to be feasible to find common themes between them and, above all, to gain relevant insights to devise effective prevention and supportive strategies for dealing with suicide risk challenges that COVID-19 will continue to pose in the foreseeable future.

This study assessed factors associated with increases in adverse community effects of COVID-19 in a refugee community in California. Methods: This study uses data from a cross-sectional survey developed and administered as part of a participatory action research project by a refugee community organization in San Diego, California. Data was collected between September and November 2020 in a sample of refugee community members (n = 517). Multivariable Poisson regression models measured associations between sociodemographic and acculturation measures with seven adverse community effects overall and stratified by duration of residence in the United States. Adverse community effects included job/wage loss, bank/cash access barriers, food insecurity, school interruptions, household violence, substance misuse and poor mental health. Results: Refugee community members reported an average of 2.1 adverse community effects that worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with job/wage loss and poor mental health the most prevalent (84% and 49%). Characteristics associated with reporting increased numbers of adverse community effects included being younger, female, childless, not actively seeking employment, living in the US for six or more years and speaking English at home. Stratified analyses show that these associations were concentrated in refugees who had lived in the US for at least six years. Conclusion: Refugee communities have experienced pervasive job losses and worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and these effects are concentrated in respondents who have lived in the US for six or more years. Additional targeted support is needed to ensure that refugees who have lived in the US for longer durations have the financial and social support needed to cope with the unprecedented challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 The Authors","California; COVID-19; Job loss; Mental health; Refugees; San Diego","adult; adverse event; age; Article; bank access barrier; California; cash access barrier; community; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; demography; drug misuse; employment; English (language); female; food insecurity; home; household; human; male; mental health; pandemic; refugee; school; sex; social aspect; United States; violence; work","L.

Solar energy systems are proving to be an easy and cheaper solution to energy crisis worldwide. Developing countries including Pakistan have augmented efforts to boost the current solar capacity. The identification of desired solar power point plant fabrication requires robust analysis of several factors. Adequate research has not been done on the site selection process for solar projects in Pakistan. This study identifies and proposes multiple point states having solar energy potential. Based on the multiple main and sub-criteria obtained from the literature, a mathematical formulation has been used to install the solar projects at rural areas of Pakistan. An empirical assessment of the off-grid rural solar power projects in Pakistan has also been conducted in this case study. The results reveal that mass, money supply and ratio are important, while the transmission on the matrix, the cost of land and the sun were generated. The study found the district of Barkhan (R2) of Baluchistan to be the most ideal site, followed by Jacobabad (R3) and Mastung (R3). With respect to economic viability, this study found that solar energy systems provide electricity which is much cheaper than conventional energy supplied in the country.

Appropriate infant feeding practices are critical to a child's growth, health, and development during the first 1000 days of life. One in every six children worldwide receives a minimum acceptable diet. According to the EDHS 2016, the status of the minimum acceptable diet was 7 percent among children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia. The study sought to ascertain the relationship between complementary feeding (CF) indicators and household food insecurity in children aged 6-23 months. Methods. A systematic sampling method was used to conduct a cross-sectional study of 536 mother-child pairs aged 6-23 months. The 24-hour dietary recall was used to collect data on CF practices using face-to-face interviews with socioeconomic and food security questionnaires. The relationship between complementary feeding indicators and household food insecurity was investigated using logistic regression analysis. The relationship between independent variables and complementary feeding indicators was determined using multivariate logistic regression. Results. Overall, a total of 67.9% of children received timely introduction of CF and Minimum Meal Frequency (MMF), Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD), and Minimum Acceptable Diet were met by 61.7%, 42.5%, and 41.7%, respectively. Result of multivariate logistic regression showed there is significant association between household food security with MMF, MDD, and MAD [AOR: 2.02, 95% CI: (1.25-3.24); AOR: 1.55, 95% CI: (1.02-2.36); and AOR: 1.62, 9595% CI: (1.06-2.47)], respectively, while there was no association with introduction of CF [AOR = 0.87, 95% CI: (0.55-1.39)]. Conclusion. This study revealed that the rates of MMF, MDD, and MAD remained low in this study setting. Household socioeconomic status (wealth index, food security status, household income) and child age were found to be among the factors statistically significantly associated with complementary feeding practices indicators.  © 2022 Junayde Abdurahmen Ahmed et al.","","","J.A.

Transforming Food Systems for Affordable Healthy” (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, Rome 2020) reveals that the world is not on track to achieve the SDG 2.1 (“Universal access to safe and nutritious food”) and SDG 2.2 (“End of all forms of malnutrition”), both Zero Hunger of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (“End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture”) targets by 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. If recent trends continue, the number of people affected by hunger would increase further. The combination of moderate and more severe levels of food insecurity raises the estimate to over 25% of the world population, equivalent to a total of about 2 billion people. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems and of all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution, and consumption of food so that this circumstance further questions the achievement of the goal Zero Hunger. A very important tool to successfully tackle this serious and long-standing problem is represented by nutraceutical products and in the rehabilitation of severe patients and undernourished children, the “ready-to-use therapeutic foods” (RUTFs) have shown remarkable efficacy. They refer to a number of varieties of ready-to-eat foods, ranging from those prepared from locally available ingredients by village women in their own self-help groups for the malnourished children to those prepared according to specific formulas in worldwide factories. RUTF now almost always refers to the latter and it is a generic term including different types of foodstuff, such as spreads or compressed products with precise amounts of nutrients, mainly derived from powdered milk, peanut, oil, sugar, and micronutrients, providing energy equivalent to WHO requirement. However, the local availability of the necessary ingredients limits the production in geographical areas where their use is required, thus there are currently important efforts in the research for alternative ingredients to overcome this limitation. The purpose of this study is to trace the current scenario in terms of food security and malnutrition in the world, focusing attention on the problems associated with the dissemination of initiatives aimed at addressing such a global challenge. The research was conducted following the tripartition model both in the analysis of the problem and in the proposed answer model, although the business perspective was the privileged one. Encouraging the proper and effective implementation of an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable local market for RUTFs means creating shared values, acting jointly, and maximizing the results in favour of children and their families who are still fighting for the right to live in dignity. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Against this background, the present analysis tests human capital theory predictions by assessing the resilience effect of formal education vis- a-vis food and financial insecurity in Burkina Faso. This is achieved using data on 10,411 households, extracted from the latest available wave of the Burkina Faso’s National Survey on Households Living Conditions, along with geospatial meta-data and semi-parametric modelling techniques. The findings reveal that relaxing the linearity and independence assumptions provides a more robust representation of the systemic and inter-dependent relationship that exists between education, food and monetary security. In fact, education is found to increase the joint likelihood of food and monetary security in the country. Specifically, compared to households headed by individuals with no education, those headed by primary, secondary or higher educated individuals are 19.8%, 49.7% and 1.189 times, respectively, more likely to experience food security, and 40.1%, 77% and 1.723 times, respectively, more likely to come out of poverty. Therefore, easing access to formal education ought to be part of the solution mix sitting squarely at the poverty/food insecurity nexus, for a sustainable future beyond the pandemic. This is indeed supported by the high positive correlation of 0.927 between the incidence of food and monetary security, which suggests that coordinated efforts in those sectors will have much greater development’s returns than isolated initiatives. © 2021 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.","Burkina Faso; C50; discrete choice modelling; education; food security; I20; I32; O50; poverty; sustainable development","","I.

Population growth, as well as the intensive use of water resources for industrial and agricultural activities, among others, have caused water stress in various regions of the world. Rural areas are usually more affected due to water scarcity and a lack of sanitary infrastructure. The current practices associated with urban water management have been considered inefficient to respond to these problems. In recent years, the reuse of greywater has emerged as a promising and sustainable alternative. Several pilot greywater treatment systems have been implemented in rural areas of different countries, however, studies about the environmental impacts of these decentralized systems under different scenarios are lacking. In this work, the life cycle assessment of greywater treatment systems considering several scenarios was studied. Our results showed that the decrease in environmental impacts due to the saving of drinking water is more evident when the water supply is carried out through cistern trucks. This occurs because the environmental impact of land transport of water is extremely high and represents over 89% of the global warming indicator [kg CO2 eq] and 96% ozone depletion [kg CFC-11 eq] contributions of the system. Greywater treatment systems with backwashing and solar panels as a source of energy have lower environmental impacts, reducing CO2 and CFC emissions by 50% for the maintenance phase and by 85% (CO2) and 47% (CFC) for the operation phase. Furthermore, the acquisition of solar panels was economically feasible, with a payback of 19.7 years. This analysis showed the environmental feasibility of small-scale greywater treatment systems in rural areas affected by water scarcity. Furthermore, the proposed approach has contributed to understand the impact of greywater treatment systems in rural areas, which could become a support tool to integrate greywater reuse practices in different communities. © 2018","Environmental impacts; Greywater reuse; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Rural areas; Water reuse; Water scarcity","Animals; Life Cycle Stages; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water; Water Purification; Water Supply; Indicator indicator; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Population statistics; Potable water; Rural areas; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Wastewater reclamation; Water supply; carbon dioxide; drinking water; sulfur dioxide; trichlorofluoromethane; zeolite; water; Greywater reuse; Greywater treatment; Life cycle assessment; Population growth; Reuse management; Solar panels; Treatment systems; Water reuse; Water scarcity; Waters resources; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; recycling; rural area; wastewater treatment; water availability; water management; acidification; air pollution; Article; carcinogenic activity; ecotoxicity; energy resource; eutrophication; feasibility study; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; life expectancy; municipal solid waste; ozone depletion; particulate matter; respiratory function; sensitivity analysis; smog; waste water management; waste water recycling; water insecurity; water pollution; water supply; water transport; animal; life cycle stage; sewage; water management; Water conservation","C.

The wine industry, due to its growing market, has matured the need to develop an approach for understanding the environmental impacts of its products and to develop strategies to reduce such impacts in a life cycle perspective. This study has a two-fold aim: presenting the development of a methodological proposal for the use of PEF and PEF-CR in the eco-design of wine products; testing its applicability in a case study in the wine sector. The methodological proposal considered the combination of ISO 14006 and PEF methods into a procedure consisting of 8 steps. The proposal was successfully applied in the case of an Italian vinery committed to develop a new red wine product with improved performance if compared to its standard red wine production. The study occurred between 2018 and 2020, collecting primary data related to vineyards and vinery operations. Results proved that PEF method and PEF-CR can be effectively used in the eco-design of new wine products with reduced environmental impacts. Moreover, the study confirmed that PEF method can be used within the framework of ISO 14006. The study on standard red wine production confirmed that the fuel and pesticide consumption in the vineyard operation are environmental hotspots. To reduce these impacts, a new selection of Merlot Khorus grapes was made by the Italian vinery. Results of the eco-designed proved that the new product scored a reduction in the potential environmental impacts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental Passport; Farm-to-fork; Life cycle assessment; Merlot; Red wine","Environment; Farms; Italy; Vitis; Wine; Italy; Vitaceae; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Planning; Product design; Sustainable development; Wine; copper sulfate; diesel fuel; fuel; gasoline; herbicide; pesticide; polyethylene; Design-process; Environmental footprints; Environmental passport; Farm-to-fork; Growing markets; Merlot; Red wine; Wine industry; Wine production; Wine products; ecological footprint; environmental economics; life cycle analysis; standardization; sustainable development; vineyard; wine industry; acidification; Article; climate change; eco design process; ecotoxicity; electricity; energy footprint; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental footprint; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; eutrophication; fermentation; grape; human; land use; merlot khorus grape; methodology; ozone depletion; product environmental footprint method; productivity; red wine; sedimentation; sensitivity analysis; vineyard; waste management; wastewater; water insecurity; wine; wine industry; agricultural land; environment; Italy; Vitis; wine; Life cycle","A.

This impact has disproportionately affected LMICs (lower- and/or middle-income countries), already burdened by a lack of neurosurgical resources. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to examine these challenges and innovations developed to adapt effective teaching and learning for medical students and neurosurgical trainees. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and The Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions. MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were accessed, searching and screening literature from December 2019 to 5th December 2020 with set inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening identified 1254 articles of which 26 were included, providing data from 96 countries. Twenty-three studies reported transition to online learning, with 8 studies also mentioned redeployment into COVID wards with 2 studies mentioning missed surgical exposure as a consequence. Of 7 studies conducted in LMICs, 3 reported residents suffering financial insecurities from reduced surgical caseload and recession. Significant global disruption in neurosurgical teaching and training has arisen from the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreased surgical exposure has negatively impacted educational provision. However, advancements in virtual technology have allowed for more affordable, accessible training especially in LMICs. Using this, initiatives to reduce physical and mental stress experienced by trainees should be paramount. © 2021, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Education; Global surgery; Neurosurgery; Pandemic","COVID-19; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Pandemics; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Cochrane Library; coronavirus disease 2019; e-learning; education; human; medical student; mental health; meta analysis; neurosurgery; pandemic; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; residency education; Review; skill; surgery; surgical training; systematic review; meta analysis (topic)","N.S.

India’s lockdown, one of the harshest in the world, came with additional challenges for women. This paper aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related pathways on the first thousand days of life in the Integrated Child Development Scheme and the public distribution ecosystem in India. Data sources: Using Cochrane guidelines, electronic databases, namely Google Scholar and PubMed-NCBI, were searched for evidence between 1 March 2020 and 1 May 2022. A total of 73 studies were identified in initial search; 20 met the inclusion criteria and, thus, were included in the research analysis. Primary studies were conducted throughout pan-India in rural, urban, and semi-urban areas to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related pathways on the first 1000 days of life. The impact of social security, food insecurity, service delivery, nutrition of pregnant and nursing mothers (P&NMs), and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) varied between geographies and within geographies. Most of the primary studies were conducted at small scale, while only three studies were pan-Indian. The majority of studies were conducted on the mental health of P&NMs and pre-natal and post-natal service delivery disruption. The paucity of the available literature highlights the need to undertake research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic-related pathways on 1000 days of life in India and worldwide. The best implementation practices were observed where cross-sectional programs were carried out in relation to health services and social security for P&NMs and children. © 2022 by the authors.","1000 days; children under two years; COVID-19; India; pregnant and nursing mothers","Child; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ecosystem; Female; Humans; India; Infant; Pandemics; Pregnancy; Public Health; Social Security; India; child health; COVID-19; epidemic; health services; nutrition; public health; social security; child development; child health; child nutrition; coronavirus disease 2019; data base; data synthesis; depression; ecosystem; first 1000 days of life; food insecurity; food security; geographic distribution; growth, development and aging; health care access; health care delivery; health program; health service; household; human; immunization; India; infant feeding; maternal nutrition; maternal welfare; mental health; nutrition service; pandemic; perinatal period; practice guideline; pregnant woman; prenatal period; public health service; Review; rural area; social care; social security; social support; urban area; child; communicable disease control; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; female; India; infant; pandemic; pregnancy; public health","S.

This includes a negative impact on the food system and economic aspect of almost all countries. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic came when food security is recognised as a complex problem, since it stands among numerous social problems that need to be addressed globally. The South African government has established the National Policy for Food and Nutrition Security to deal with food insecurity. The significance of this paper is to research the extent to which the governments have been responding to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in South African. This study is qualitative and the case study research design was used to collect secondary data while textual analysis was used for data analysis. It is acknowledged that there is instability in the food supply as the poor people were forced to purchase expensive food from the supermarkets due to the closure of local flea markets and street vendors. As the lockdown regulations were lifted in South Africa, the key aspects of the findings reveal that the selling of unsafe food from the informal sector, which mostly supplies the poorest of the poor has threatened food security.

Due to rise in demand for proficient transmission of worldwide information and communication, a portable podium is required. Small electronic devices such as portable computers, mobile phones and other electronic devices serve as encouraging entrants that have endorsed the swift progression of information handling and allocation. Attributable to the increased use of portable electronic devices, the batteries have become closely associated with human life and hardly there will be an area without its application. The devices used for these purposes are made of critical elements which have matchless properties inimitable by other materials. Such metals are in high ultimatum and head-on supply insecurity because of several hurdles in recycling technologies. For handling the supply challenges associated with these metals, new approaches have been adopted to isolate these elements from secondary sources. The discarding of voluminous spent batteries has produced a compulsion to discover ways to recover and recycle metals that exist for the development of recycling facility. This report is envisioned to be an appreciated reference for providing state of art of hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical treatments for the management of spent nickel metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. It has been revealed that efficient hydrometallurgical recycling techniques proved to be helpful in terms of environmental defence and maintenance of resources. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Hydrometallurgy; Leaching; Life Cycle Assessment; Recycling; Solvent Extraction","Electron devices; Electronic Waste; Hydrides; Hydrometallurgy; Metal recovery; Metals; Microcomputers; Nickel compounds; Nickel metal hydride batteries; Portable equipment; Pyrometallurgy; Recycling; Thermoelectric equipment; Information and communication; Information handling; Nickel metal hydride; Portable electronic devices; Pyrometallurgical treatments; Recycling facilities; Recycling techniques; Recycling technology; fuel cell; leaching; life cycle analysis; literature review; maintenance; metal; nickel; recycling; solvent; Lithium-ion batteries","S.

The government have a joint goal of achieving a favourable balance of trade and food security; hence this study examines the causal relationship between quality of governance and net-import dependency on food and agricultural products for 25 SSA countries during the period 1995-2015. Principal component analysis is employed to develop a governance index based on the six worldwide governance indicators and a multivariate panel vector error correction framework applied to infer causality in the short and long run. The results reveal that a higher governance index is correlated with a lower net-import dependency ratio and the relationship is statistically significant. Evidence of unidirectional causality running from governance to net-import dependency is reported in 14 SSA countries, mainly in the long run. In conclusion, improving governance quality could support reduced food and agricultural net-import dependency through promoting agriculture production, exports and consequently reduced trade deficits in the long run. Hence, governance reforms in the region should be placed at the heart of the agricultural development agenda. © 2021, University of Coruna, Faculty of Economics and Business.

The COVID-19 pandemic has crippled health systems, exacerbated household food insecurity, and reversed economic growth, which together could set back improvements in undernutrition across low-income and middle-income countries. This paper highlights how the evidence base for nutrition, health, food systems, social protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions has evolved since the 2013 Lancet Series on maternal and child nutrition and identifies the priority actions needed to regain and accelerate progress within the next decade. Policies and interventions targeting the first 1000 days of life, including some newly identified since 2013, require renewed commitment, implementation research, and increased funding from both domestic and global actors. A new body of evidence from national and state-level success stories in stunting reduction reinforces the crucial importance of multisectoral actions to address the underlying determinants of undernutrition and identifies key features of enabling political environments. To support these actions, well-resourced nutrition data and information systems are essential. The paper concludes with a call to action for the 2021 Nutrition for Growth Summit to unite global and national nutrition stakeholders around common priorities to tackle a large, unfinished undernutrition agenda—now amplified by the COVID-19 crisis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Nutrition Disorders; COVID-19; Developing Countries; Female; Food Insecurity; Health Policy; Humans; Malnutrition; Pandemics; Social Determinants of Health; Sustainable Development; adolescent health; biofortification; child nutrition; climate change; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; disease burden; disease severity; evidence based medicine; food security; health care quality; health care system; human; malnutrition; maternal nutrition; pandemic; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; sanitation; sustainable development; adolescent; adult; child; developing country; economics; female; food insecurity; health care policy; malnutrition; nutritional disorder; social determinants of health","Z.A.

Residents of urban informal settlements faced particularly stringent conditions during the response in India. Counsellors spoke with registered survivors of domestic violence in Mumbai, with two objectives: To understand how the pandemic and subsequent lockdown had changed their needs and experiences, and to recommend programmatic responses. Design Qualitative interviews and framework analysis. Setting A non-government support programme for survivors of violence against women, providing services mainly for residents of informal settlements. Participants During follow-up telephone counselling with survivors of violence against women who had previously registered for support and consented to the use of information in research, counsellors took verbal consent for additional questions about the effects of COVID-19 on their daily life, their ability to speak with someone, and their counselling preferences. Responses were recorded as written notes. Results The major concerns of 586 clients interviewed between April and July 2020 were meeting basic needs (financial stress, interrupted livelihoods and food insecurity), confinement in small homes (family tensions and isolation with abusers) and limited mobility (power imbalances in the home and lack of opportunity for disclosure and stress relief). A major source of stress was the increased burden of unpaid domestic care, which fell largely on women. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the burden of poverty and gendered unpaid care. Finance and food security are critical considerations for future response, which should consider inequality, financial support, prioritising continued availability of services for survivors of violence and expanding access to social networks. Decision-makers must be aware of the gendered, intersectional effects of interventions and must include residents of informal settlements who are survivors of domestic violence in the planning and implementation of public health strategies.  © 2021 Author(s).

Multiple epistemes, in which public health imperatives confront and negotiate locally derived knowledge and traditions, vie for legitimacy and agency, resulting in new cultural forms. (2) Methods: To investigate the context and construction of community responses, a systematic review of qualitative literature was conducted with the aim of evaluating those insights provided by empirical, social field research in low-and middle-income countries since the onset of COVID-19. Six scholarly databases were searched for empirical, qualitative, field-based, or participatory research that was published in peer-reviewed journals between December 2019 and August 2021. (3) Results: Twenty-five studies were selected for data extraction, following critical appraisal for methodological rigor by two independent reviewers, and were then analyzed themat-ically. Faced with unprecedented social ruptures, restrictions in social and physical mobility, and ever-looming uncertainties of infection, financial insecurity, stigma, and loss, communities worldwide reacted in multiple and complex ways. Pervasive misinformation and fear of social rejection resulted in noncompliance with pandemic sanctions, resistance, and increased isolation, allowing the spread of the disease. The meaning of, and understandings about, COVID-19 were constructed using traditional, religious, and biomedical epistemologies, which were occasionally in conflict with each other. Innovations and adaptations, through syntheses of traditional and biomedical discourses and practice, illustrated community resilience and provided models for successful engagement to improve public health outcomes. (4) Conclusion: Local context and community engagement were indispensable considerations when enacting effective public health interventions to meet the challenges of the pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

Later, in 2015, the UN defined gender equality as one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals to transform the world. During all these years, gender and urban space have been the subject of studies, research, interventions, reflections, and discussions worldwide but also in Latin America and the Caribbean region. Following the path of urban equality, this chapter presents a systematic review of the current predominant orientations in urban studies in Latin America and the Caribbean, organized according to three thematic axes, which are of utmost importance in the built environment: fear and insecurity, care, and mobility, putting special emphasis on the differences that gender constructs in the ways of conceiving the space and the city, the definition of women as research subjects, and gender as a category of urban analysis. A systematic and rigorous review of the available evidence is carried out. For this purpose, we set three stages of analysis. First, we examine the theoretical and conceptual debates around the incorporation of gender in urban studies. Second, we turn our attention to empirical studies that point to the centrality of the urban environment in gender analysis. In the last section, a review of the main institutional responses to mobility, insecurity, and care problems in the region is carried out, and manifold examples of interventions are presented. Our study shows that to achieve better results, gender equality needs to be reinforced by a participatory design approach involving all stakeholders, it needs to be achieved in all areas influencing urban and transport planning, and finally, specific measures should be implemented to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Jesús Manuel González-Pérez, Clara Irazábal, and Rubén Camilo Lois-González.","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","978-100060588-4; 978-036767740-4","","","English","The Routledge Handb. of Urban Studies in Latin America and the Caribbean: Cities, Urban Processes, and Policies","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142840346"

The study objectives were accomplished via the use of descriptive statistics, the USDA's technique for quantifying food insecurity, and multinomial regression analysis. The research found that none of the households were food secure, whereas 39.2% were food insecure without hunger (FIWH), 22.5% were food insecure with moderate hunger (FIWHM), and 38.3% were food insecure with severe hunger (FIWHS). It was also found that age, the number of years of experience of garri processors, the size of the family, and garri processing technology are all important predictors of food insecurity. The effective coping methods employed in the research region to combat food insecurity are access to remittances to purchase food, intake of grains only and engaging in off-farm jobs to supplement family income, access to remittance to purchase food and borrowing money to purchase food items. Consequently, we suggest the need for intervention to subsidise modern technologies in garri processing technology since the traditional processing methods are labour intensive and yield little return on investment. © 2022 Trop.

COVID-19 was identified in 2020 and was named SARS-CoV-2. To limit worldwide contagion, many countries instituted a lockdown, which conducted to disruption of routine life. In fact, pandemic was associated with several stresses among population, such as loss of employment, deaths of family members, friends, or colleagues, financial insecurity, and isolation. This led to long-lasting psychosocial effects as anxiety and depression, increasing the prevalence of stress and traumarelated disorders in the population. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between lower urinary tracts symptoms (LUTS) and stress/depressive symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: An anonymous cross-sectional webbased survey (comprehending anthropometric data, education level, occupation status, smoking and alcohol habits, current therapies, quarantine and COVID-19 infection status) was conducted from March to May 2020 in Italy. LUTS were examined through National Institute of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) and Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI). Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was utilized to evaluate depressive and anxiety symptoms. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H Test was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 356 out of 461 subjects fully completed the survey, with a response rate of 77.2%. Data showed that subjects involved in economic difficulties, quarantine measures or with increased HDRS reported a significative statistic worsened urinary symptoms (H(3) = 11.731, p = 0.008), quality of life, (H(3) = 10.301, p = 0.016), total NIH-CPSI/GUPI score (H(3) = 42.150, p = 0.000), and quality of life (H(3) = 48.638, p = 0.000). Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic provoked several alterations in everyday life. Although general lockdown, quarantine and social distancing have been necessary to prevent virus spreading, this had long term effects on all population in terms of mental and physical health. NIH-CPSI and GUPI scores increased linearly with stress and anxiety levels measured at HDRS, confirming worse LUTS in subjects who suffered anxiety and stress from COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 Edizioni Scripta Manent s.n.c..

As an important part of worldwide land conservation, sustainable development and management of water resources, developing countries must ensure the use of innovative technology and tools that support their various decision making systems. This study provides the most recent LULC change analysis for the last six years (2015–2021) of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico, one of the most important petrochemical cities in the world and host of the ongoing Interoceanic Corridor project. The analysis was carried out using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images, ancillary data and ground-based surveys and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify and to ameliorate the discrimination between four main macro-classes and fourteen classes. The LULC classification was performed using the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) to produce maps for each year, as it was found to be the best approach when compared to minimum distance (MDM) and spectral angle mapping (SAM) methods. The macro-classes were water, built-up, vegetation and bare soil, whereas the classes were an improved classification within those. Our study achieved both user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) above 90% for the proposed macro-classes and classes. The average Kappa coefficient for macro-classes was 0.93, while for classes it was 0.96, both comparable to previous studies. The results from the LULC analysis show that residential, industry and commercial areas slowed down their growth throughout the study period. These changes were associated with socio-economical drivers such as insecurity and lack of economic investments. Groves and trees presented steady behaviors, with small increments during the five-year period. Swamps, on the other hand, significantly degraded, being about 2% of the study area in 2015 and 0.93% in 2021. Dunes and medium and high vegetation densities (∼ 80%) transitioned mostly to low vegetation densities. This behavior is associated with rainfall below the annual reference and increments of surface runoff due to the loss of vegetation cover. Lastly, the present study seeks to highlight the importance of remote sensing for a better understanding of the dynamics between human–nature interactions and to provide information to assist planners and decision-makers for more sustainable land development. © 2022 by the authors.

In the current pandemic scenario of coronavirus Brazil has experienced an epidemic peak of hunger, amplifying existing prepandemic vulnerabilities, mainly in the North Region of the country. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of food insecurity and its associated factors in homes with children under 5 years of age in an urban area of a municipality of the western Brazilian Amazon. Methods: A household survey was conducted with a probabilistic sample of 557 children and their families. Food insecurity (FI) was determined using the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Associations between variables were analyzed based on the prevalence ratio (PR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated through multiple Poisson regression analysis. Variables with a P value < 0.05 after adjustments were considered significantly associated with the outcome. Results: A prevalence of 76.5% (CI 1.36–2.67) food insecurity was found among the families in the study; 42.9% had moderate (CI 1.31–2.83) and severe (CI 1.10–1.83) food insecurity. Moderate and severe FI was associated with low family income (P = 0.00), participation in governmental income transfer programs (P = 0.01), and heads of household with less than 7 years of schooling (P = 0.02). Moreover, substantial frequencies of height deficit and being overweight were found among the children. Conclusions: The high prevalence of hunger and food insecurity and its associated factors reflects the context of geographic isolation and social exclusion in which these families live, suggesting that a substantial portion of the population under 5 years of age had experienced episodes of hunger in the 90 days prior to the survey. The prevalence of height deficit and being overweight among the children reveals a scenario of epidemiological/nutritional polarization, requiring the formulation of specific public policies for this population. © 2022, The Author(s).","Food and nutritional security; Nutrition programs and policies: nutritional epidemiology; Nutritional surveys; Social inequality","Brazil; Child; Child, Preschool; Food Supply; Humans; Hunger; Overweight; Poverty; Socioeconomic Factors; Brazil; catering service; child; human; hunger; obesity; poverty; preschool child; socioeconomics","M.A.T. de Medeiros; Department of Public Policies and Collective Health, Health and Society Institute, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), Santos, Silva Jardim Street, 136, Vila Mathias, SP, 11015-020, Brazil; email: angelica.medeiros@unifesp.br","","BioMed Central Ltd","16060997","","JHPNA","35978447","English","J.

Despite a 2 to 3 times higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, around 2 million HIV positive women give birth each year globally. However, there is a dearth of evidences in Ethiopia about the effect of maternal HIV infection on pregnancy outcomes where adverse birth outcomes are still a significant health problem. This study is, therefore, aimed to examine the effect of HIV on the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 704 pregnant women (352 women with HIV and 352 women without HIV infection). Systematic random sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. Data on socio-demographic, obstetric, clinical, as well as behavioral and psychosocial characteristics were collected using a validated tool. Data on the outcome variables were also collected following delivery. Modified Poisson regression was employed to estimate the relative risk (RR) of HIV on low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth, and still birth at 95% confidence level. Attributable fraction (AF) was used to report the impact of HIV infection on pregnancy outcomes. Results: Of the total 704 pregnant women enrolled for the study, 96.3% (678) completed the study. The mean age of the study participants was 30.8 (SD ± 5.4) for HIV positive and 27 (SD ± 5.4) for HIV negative women. The cumulative incidence of low birth weight, preterm birth, and stillbirth were 21.4%, 9.4%, and 4.1%, respectively. The incidence of LBW was 24.7% among HIV positive and 17.8% among HIV negative women. The incidence of preterm birth was 10.7% among HIV positive and 7.9% among HIV negative women. And the incidence of stillbirth was 3.7% and 4.6% among HIV positive and those HIV negative women. New-borns from women with HIV infection had a higher risk of low birth weight and preterm birth than those HIV negative women (Adjusted Relative Risk (ARR) = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.06–2.03) and (ARR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.08–2.79), respectively. The attributable risk of HIV on low birth weight was 32% (Attributable Fraction (AF) = 32%, 95% CI: 23–46%), and 43% (AF = 43%, 95% CI: 23–46%) for preterm birth. Conclusion: Maternal HIV infection increased the risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. This implies due attention is required while providing maternal health services primarily antenatal care and delivery services. These services should be aimed at reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes with more attention given to women with HIV infection. Moreover, reinforcement of HIV prevention intervention strategies should be considered at all levels. © 2022 Worku et al.","Ethiopia; HIV infection; low birth weight; preterm birth; stillbirth","Human immunodeficiency virus antibody; antiretroviral therapy; Article; birth weight; cohort analysis; depression; female; food insecurity; gestational age; gynecologist; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; low birth weight; medical record; menstrual cycle; mother to child transmission; postnatal depression; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; prenatal care; prenatal diagnosis; public health; quality of life; questionnaire; risk factor; stillbirth; tertiary care center; ultrasound","W.Z.

We aimed to develop an index that could capture the nutrient dimension of nutritional security, a nutrient security index (named SecDiet), and evaluate its apparent validity. The SecDiet (range: 0-1) is based on the square-weighted average of the probabilities that the intake of twelve critical nutrients exceeds the threshold value associated with a risk of overt deficiency. Using adult populations from a French representative survey (INCA3, n 1774) and a large cohort (NutriNet-Santé, n 104 382), the content and construct validity of the SecDiet was evaluated by estimating associations of the SecDiet with its components and with relevant socio-demographic characteristics. The SecDiet was high in the overall population (0·93 (SD 0·09) in INCA3) and markedly skewed towards 1 (i.e. lower risk of insufficient intake). It correlated positively with its twelve components (r 0·17-0·78, all P < 0·001). The SecDiet was associated with monthly income (P = 0·002), perception of financial situation, professional situation, food insufficiency and security statuses (all P < 0·001) in the INCA3 population and with monthly income, professional situation and level of education (all P < 0·001) in the NutriNet-Santé population. Unlike a broader nutrient-based quality index taken as comparison, the SecDiet mean decreased and the tail of its distribution notably extended downwards in at-risk sub-populations, thus revealing its specific sensitivity. The SecDiet could be used to screen sub-groups or study the determinants of nutrient insecurity in large population surveys.  © ","Dietary indexes; Micronutrient deficiencies; Nutrition; Nutritional security","Adult; Cohort Studies; Diet; Diet Surveys; Food; Food Security; France; Humans; Nutrients; Nutritional Status; Sociodemographic Factors; adult; Article; construct validity; dietary intake; educational status; female; food security; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nutritional assessment; nutritional deficiency; social determinants of health; cohort analysis; diet; food; France; nutritional status","F.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the special issue was to rapidly collect information, analysis and perspectives from as many regions as possible on the initial impacts of the pandemic on global agricultural systems, The overall goal for the special issue was to develop a useful repository for this information as well as to use the journal's international reach to share this information with the agricultural systems research community and journal readership. METHODS: The editorial team put out a call for a special issue to capture the initial effects of the pandemic on the agricultural sector. We also recruited teams from eight global regions to write papers summarizing the impacts of the first waves of the pandemic in their area. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The work of the regional teams and the broader research community resulted in eight regional summary papers, as well as thirty targeted research articles. In these papers, we find that COVID-19 and global pandemic mitigation measures have had significant and sometimes unexpected impacts on our agricultural systems via shocks to agricultural labour markets, trade and value chains. And, given the high degree of overlap between low income populations and subsistence agricultural production in many regions, we also document significant shocks to food security for these populations, and the high potential for long term losses in terms of human, natural, institutional and economic capital. While we also documented instances of agricultural system resilience capacities, they were not universally accessible. We see particular need to shore up vulnerable agricultural systems and populations most negatively affected by the pandemic and to mitigate pandemic-related losses to preserve other agricultural systems policy objectives, such as improving food security, or addressing climate change. SIGNIFICANCE: Despite rapid development of vaccines, the pandemic continues to roll on as of the time of writing (early 2022). Only time will tell how the dynamics described in this Special Issue will play out in the coming years. Evidence of agricultural system resilience capacities provides some hopeful perspectives, but also highlights the need to boost these capacities across a wider cross section of agricultural systems and encourage agri-food systems transformation to prepare for more challenges ahead. © 2022","Agricultural and food value chains; COVID-19 mitigation; COVID-19 pandemic; Food insecurity; Inequality; Resilience","agricultural policy; agricultural production; COVID-19; equity; farming system; food security; seasonal variation","E.

In particular, to our knowledge, there has been little report concerning Ethiopian lactating women regarding their micronutrient intake. Our objective was to assess micronutrient intake inadequacy and its associated factors among lactating women in Bahir Dar city, Northwest Ethiopia, 2021. Methods Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 15 to March 05, 2021. Four hundred thirteen respondents were selected through systematic random sampling. Data were collected by interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire and a single multiphasic 24 hours dietary recall was used to assess dietary assessment. Data entry and analysis were carried out using EpiData and SPSS respectively. The ESHA food processor, Ethiopian food composition table, and world food composition table have used the calculation of nutrient values of the selected micronutrient. The nutrient intakes were assessed by Nutrient Adequacy Ratio (NAR) and Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR). Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was done to identify the factors of overall micronutrient intake inadequacy. Result The overall prevalence of micronutrient intake inadequacy across 12 nutrients was 39.9% [95% CI (34.9, 45.0)]. The inadequate intake of vitamin A was 98.2%. Similarly, the inadequate intake of B vitamins ranges from 13.4% to 68.5%. The insufficient intakes of calcium, iron, and zinc were 70.9%, 0%, and 4.7%, respectively. Around 36 and 91.6% of the respondents had inadequate intake of selenium and sodium, respectively. On multivariable logistic regression analysis; Being divorced was 2.7 times more likely to have overall micronutrient intake inadequacy than being married [AOR = 2.71, 95% CI (1.01, 7.33)]. The odds of overall micronutrient intake inadequacy were 2.6 higher in merchants than in housewives [AOR = 2.63, 95% CI (1.40, 4.93)]. Lactating women who had poor nutritional knowledge were 2.7 times more likely to have overall micronutrient intake inadequacy than those who had good nutritional knowledge [AOR = 2.71, 95% CI (1.47, 4.99)]. Conclusion and recommendation Overall, the micronutrient intake in lactating women was lower than the recommended levels. Therefore; educating lactating women about appropriate dietary intake is essential. Copyright: © 2022 Awoke et al.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic brought challenging times for nurses worldwide. In Brazil, as well as in several countries, nurses are working hard in hospital settings caring for patients infected with the virus, sometimes with unfavourable work environment conditions. Methods: This study was a convergent embedded mixed methods research. The sample comprised 104 nurses from three Brazilian university hospitals. Data were collected in April–June 2020 from an online questionnaire with a self-reporting Likert scale survey designed to measure the nurses' perceptions of their work environment. Qualitative data in the form of written comments were also collected through an open question. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Results: The quantitative results showed that the responses to ‘I received training on the correct use of personal protective equipment’ and ‘I am afraid of being infected’ items had the best and worst evaluations, respectively. The qualitative findings revealed five themes: feeling of insecurity, lack of personal protective equipment, lack of diagnostic tests, changes in the care flow and fear of the unknown. Conclusion: The study has highlighted the challenges faced by hospital nurses while caring for patients with COVID-19. Implications for Nursing and Nursing Policy: The gaps identified will assist the policymakers and hospital managers in developing policies to enhance the support offered to nurses and improve the care provided to patients with COVID-19 in university hospitals. The results also indicate the need for attention to the mental health of the professionals due to the increasing workload and treatment of an illness hitherto unknown. © 2021 International Council of Nurses","coronavirus infections; hospitals; nurse's role; organization and administration; pandemics; university; work environment","Adult; Brazil; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals, University; Humans; Male; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workplace; adult; Brazil; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; human; male; multicenter study; nursing; nursing staff; pandemic; psychology; questionnaire; university hospital; virology; virus pneumonia; workplace","J.L.G.D.

Roadmaps are developed and grid analyses are performed here for 145 countries to address these problems. The roadmaps call for a 100% transition of all-purpose business-as-usual (BAU) energy to wind-water-solar (WWS) energy, efficiency, and storage, ideally by 2035, but by no later than 2050, with at least 80% by 2030. Grid stability analyses find that the countries, grouped into 24 regions, can exactly match demand with 100% WWS supply and storage, from 2050-2052. Worldwide, WWS reduces end-use energy by 56.4%, private annual energy costs by 62.7% (from $17.8 to $6.6 trillion per year), and social (private plus health plus climate) annual energy costs by 92.0% (from $83.2 to $6.6 trillion per year) at a present-value cost of ∼$61.5 trillion. The mean payback times of the capital cost due to energy- and social-cost savings are 5.5 and 0.8 years, respectively. WWS is estimated to create 28.4 million more long-term, full-time jobs than lost worldwide and may need only ∼0.17% and ∼0.36% of world land for new footprint and spacing, respectively. Thus, WWS requires less energy, costs less, and creates more jobs than BAU. Sensitivity test indicate the following. Increasing district heating and cooling may reduce costs by allowing flexible loads to replace inflexible loads, thereby replacing electricity storage and overgeneration with low-cost heat storage. A battery cost that is 50% higher than in the base case increases mean overall energy costs by only 3.2 (0.03-14.5)%. Almost all regions need fewer hours of load shifting than assumed in the base case, suggesting that actual load shifting may be easier than assumed. Increasing the use of electricity for hydrogen fuel-cell-electric vehicles instead of for battery-electric vehicles increases overall cost in most regions tested, due to the greater efficiency of battery-electric vehicles, but decreases overall cost in some regions by improving grid stability. Finally, shifting battery vehicle charging from day-night to mostly day charging reduces cost in the regions tested; shifting to mostly night charging increases cost. Ninety-five percent of the technologies needed to implement the plans proposed are already commercial. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Air pollution; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Fuel cells; Global warming; Hydrogen storage; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; Annual energy costs; Battery-electric vehicles; Business-as-usual; Energy; Energy cost; Energy insecurity; Grid stability; Load shifting; Reduce costs; Roadmap; electricity; Heat storage","M.Z.

Yet migration options for those fleeing conflicts and insecurity are more or less dangerous, desirable and doable and differences in trajectories have to do with people's ability to mobilise resources at a given time and in a given space. Based on 42 semistructured interviews conducted with Syrians who fled to Lebanon and Turkey between 2012 and 2017, this article focuses on how trajectories of exile are shaped by the interactions between social class and the specificities of the context of reception. These countries are similar to the extent that they both border Syria and host the largest numbers of Syrian refugees worldwide. Yet their respective policies, as well as their unique historical, legal and socio-economic contexts, create different impacts on refugee trajectories and refugees' experience of inequality. We argue that as a result of the different contexts of reception for Syrians in Lebanon and Turkey, refugees' strategies to reduce precarity also differ significantly. As such, the relevance and usefulness of any given form of capital vary. Results indicate that survival strategies and mobilisation of capital in Lebanon revolve around obtaining legal status, whereas in Turkey, where all Syrian refugees benefit from legal status under the temporary protection regime, capital is mainly used to negotiate an exploitative labour market. Our study challenges conventional class analyses that imply direct links between the possession of economic and social capital and favourable trajectories of exile. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Lebanon; migration policies; social class; Syrian refugees; Turkey","Lebanon; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; class; immigrant population; immigration policy; international migration; refugee; trajectory","M.

Another is to minimize hunger and food insecurity, with regard to equity. Firstly, we use Euclidean Metri and Complete Connection Method for cluster analysis according to the production efficiency and production structure of various foods. Then the countries are classified into countries with different production structures and productivity. Secondly, we quantified sustainability indicators to make standard deviations and risks to food production. Using models, principal component analysis, and factor analysis, we figure out how to distribute food among countries to maximize food productivity worldwide. Thirdly, the model is used to analyze the coefficient of food insecurity and the degree of hunger in each country, so as to obtain the utility level of food distribution in each country. The level of food utility in developed countries is relatively flat, while that in underdeveloped countries is steeper. So, the utility of food distribution in less developed countries is higher than that in developed countries. Therefore, when we measure the total utility of food, we multiply the utility difference of the insecurity factor by the quantity of food mixture and add the original food utility level to maximize the food utility level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Factor analysis; Food redistribution; Principal component analysis","Cluster analysis; Image processing; Multivariant analysis; Productivity; Sustainable development; Complete connection; Developed countries; Food distribution; Less developed countries; Production efficiency; Production structures; Standard deviation; Sustainability indicators; Factor analysis","Y.

SPSS-23 and AMOS-18 were used to test the research hypotheses using structural equation modelling and regression analysis. The findings indicated that fear of COVID-19 was associated with high job insecurity among employees from all levels. Work happiness played a mediating role in this relationship, lowering levels of fear and insecurity.

Social science scholarship has demonstrated significant relationships between mental health, food insecurity (FI), water insecurity (WI), and HIV. Little is known, however, about the temporal relationships between food and water insecurity or the mechanisms through which these multiple stressors may operate or interact to impact depression. We therefore used syndemic theory to explore the complex relationships between FI, WI, and HIV on depressive symptomatology among Kenyan women of mixed HIV status (n=183, NCT02979418). We sought to 1) understand the temporal relationships between time-variant risk factors for depression, i.e. FI and WI, and 2) assess how these factors potentially interacted with HIV to impact depressive symptomatology. We first assessed the bidirectional relationship between WI and FI using a cross-lagged three-wave, two-variable panel model. Next, we modeled depressive symptomatology at 21 months as a linear function of the potentially syndemic interaction between FI, WI, and HIV status, adjusting for household wealth. WI had a predominant predictive effect on FI (Bayesian posterior predictive p-value=0.13); there was no reverse causality for the influence of FI on WI. The interaction effect of FI, WI, and HIV was significantly associated with greater depressive symptomatology (β=0.06) at 21 months postpartum. These data suggest that water insecurity may be an important determinant of food insecurity. Further, the co-occurrence of FI, WI, and HIV increases the likelihood of maternal depressive symptomatology, i.e. there is a syndemic relationship. These findings suggest that the role of household WI in other adverse health outcomes beyond mental well-being should be examined, and that interventions to improve mental health will be more effective if they also consider concurrent resource insecurities, regardless of HIV status. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","","Bayes Theorem; Female; Food Insecurity; Food Supply; HIV Infections; Humans; Kenya; Syndemic; Water Insecurity; Kenya; Bayesian analysis; child care; food security; human immunodeficiency virus; maternal health; risk factor; womens status; adult; Article; Bayes theorem; cohort analysis; controlled study; depression; disease association; female; food insecurity; household income; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Kenyan; longitudinal study; major clinical study; nonhuman; observational study; panel study; postnatal depression; predictive model; resource shortage; risk factor; symptomatology; syndemic; water insecurity; catering service; complication; food insecurity; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Kenya; psychology","S.L.

Disasters disproportionately impact women and girls, with some evidence suggesting that violence against women and girls (VAWG) increases in disaster settings. Suggested risk factors for postdisaster VAWG include increased life stressors, failure of law enforcement, exposure to high-risk environments, exacerbation of existing gender inequalities and unequal social norms. We aim to systematically appraise the global literature on the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG. Methods We conducted a systematic review using the following databases: Embase, Global Health, Medline, PubMed and Social Policy and Practice and searched grey literature. We included quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods studies published in English language that examined the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG. We summarised the findings using a narrative synthesis approach. Results Of 555 non-duplicate records, we included a total of 37 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Among the quantitative studies, eight studies found a positive association between disaster exposure and increased VAWG, and four additional studies found positive associations with some violence types but not others. Qualitative findings offered insights into three hypothesised pathways: disaster exposure associated with (1) an increase of stressors that trigger VAWG; (2) an increase of enabling environments for VAWG and (3) an exacerbation of underlying drivers of VAWG. Conclusion As the first known global systematic review on the relationship between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG, this review contributes to the evidence base. We were limited by the quality of quantitative studies, specifically study designs, the measurement of variables and geographic scope. The severe health consequences of VAWG and increasing frequency of extreme events means that rigorously designed and better quality studies are needed to inform evidence-based policies and safeguard women and girls during and after disasters.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

As long as the anomaly continues, two outcomes are inevitable. First, an average member of the public runs the risk of paying more for any government service. Second, some or all resources earmarked for other essential needs might get sacrificed to pay for a needed public service. Such unforeseen adverse shocks could potentially increase the chances of wicked problems such as food insecurity. Consequently, this paper examined the welfare effect of bureaucratic corruption on households' ability to procure food in a safe and socially acceptable manner in sub-Saharan Africa using pooled Afrobarometer micro-level data from Rounds 5, 6, and 7 spanning 2011 to 2018. Estimates from logistic regression and the endogenous dummy variable regression that addressed the endogeneity of bureaucratic corruption in the food insecurity model revealed that bureaucratic corruption induced the experience of household food insecurity. Further analyses showed that some public entities have a more significant debilitating effect than others on household food security conditions. More importantly, any contact with government institutions causes household food security status to spiral downward. These results suggest that public institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa are weak and undoubtedly contribute to household food insecurity. Therefore, there is a need for a paradigm shift in how these entities serve the public or else a lasting solution to food insecurity might remain elusive in the region. © 2021, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.","Afrobarometer Survey; Bureaucratic corruption; Household food insecurity; Sub-Saharan Africa","Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; barometry; corruption; food security; government; paradigm shift; public service","O.M.

Design/methodology/approach: The impacts of this institutional change are analysed and discussed based on in-depth interviews conducted with faculty members of the accounting department in which they reflected upon academic success vis-a-vis the career assessment system adopted, followed up by those faculty members’ answering an electronic questionnaire about organizational identity and image perception (Gioia et al., 2000). Findings: Considering the individual perspectives, faculty are concerned about their vocations and aspirations, with feelings of apprehension and insecurity, perceiving the institutional goals as too high and potentially unattainable. By shifting the priority towards research, costs in terms of losing the institutional excellence in teaching might arise, which has been traditionally keen to the institute’s organizational identity and consistent with faculty’s perceptions of academic success. Research limitations/implications: As in any research endeavour, some limitations might emerge. First, the authors addressed the context of a specific business school, in a European country. It is certainly true that culture plays a role in terms of both organizational and national levels. The authors acknowledge this as a limitation. Nevertheless, this research takes a “local” stance, the logic of academic evaluation and its impacts on institutional and individual identity formation processes is a worldwide phenomenon. Second, in defining the authors’ selection criteria, the authors excluded the possibility of other voices to be heard, both in the department itself and in the business school. Regarding the department, the authors argue that those are the ones who could influence future decisions, considering that they are the only ones eligible for the governing bodies under the institute’s regulations. Regarding the business school, adding other department(s) means adding other discipline(s) to the authors’ analysis with specific and different dynamics of researching, publishing and teaching, which also impacts the expectations regarding career and academic success. Practical implications: First, before beginning an institutional change process, it is necessary to assess the vocations and aspirations of its members. The solution requires to reanalyse academic career premises and to reconsider the weights given to each academic activity, or furthermore, to offer more than one career path, so as to make it flexible for each faculty to follow their vocations and aspirations or to adapt to life demands. Second, in terms of organizational identity and image, the challenge is to minimize the gap between the construed external image and the internal identity, striving to achieve a balance between teaching, research, outreach and service. Originality/value: Because of the nature of the academic work, the authors propose that the application of the theory should be preceded by a careful consideration of what is academic success. The misalignments studied and reported here reveal a multilevel phenomenon, wherein individual academic identities are often in conflict with the institutional image. The authors’ study entails a contribution to the application of the identity institutional theory to academic institutions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic success; Organizational change; Organizational identity; Organizational image; Publish or perish","","S.

In so doing, the case study also illustrates how human insecurity in coltan mines in the eastern DRC interconnects with consumers worldwide through globalised trade chains. Human insecurity in the eastern DRC is manifested by the engagement of the local population in dangerous artisanal mining, the ‘industry of last resort’.

It has also impacted on the global population’s mental health and caused negative psychosocial effects, which may lead to psychological crises. During the pandemic, the challenges for quarantine hotel employees are not only the increased work-loads created by operating a quarantine hotel but also high psychological stress associated with job insecurity, risk of exposure and contagion for themselves, their friends and families. This research attempts to explore COVID-19-related depression, anxiety, and stress among quarantine hotel employees in China. The mental health of quarantine hotel employees, who have faced unprecedented changes, is paramount while they provide hospitality and care for healthcare workers and quarantine guests during mandatory quarantine periods. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that applied convenience sampling to collect questionnaire samples from 170 quarantine hotel employees in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic, from May 20 to June 10, 2020. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to collect data. The study uses descriptive analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The results reveal that 43.5% of respondents report moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression; 68.2% have moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.2% indicated moderate to extremely severe stress symptoms. Quarantine hotel employees who have a higher level of education are less likely to experience anxiety, and those with higher incomes are less likely to experience depression. Discussion: In order to mitigate the increasing levels of anxiety and depression among their staff, quarantine hoteliers or managers urgently need to implement mental health assistance programs, such as providing extra training in hygiene and knowledge about COVID-19, offering online counseling and psychological support services, training in positive thinking, encouraging staff to keep in touch with their personal support networks, and constructing a resilience model. © 2020 Teng et al.","COVID-19; DASS-21; Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; Mental health; Quarantine hotel employee","adult; anxiety disorder; Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; disease association; disease severity; educational status; employee; female; groups by age; human; income; major clinical study; male; mental health; pandemic; physiological stress; prevalence; quarantine hotel employee","K.-S.

This infection has been reported sporadically or completely absent worldwide, provided vaccination coverage of children and adults of decreed age reaches or exceeds 95%. Nevertheless, the diphtheria prophylaxis is still relevant, since from 4,000 to 7,000 cases are registered annually worldwide according to WHO. Serological testing performed in different age groups and being a part of diphtheria surveillance in our country allows us to evaluate the quality of vaccine prophylaxis and identify potential risk groups that have no protection against this infection. Objective. Assessment of the timing appropriateness of the next scheduled adult revaccination and determination of the risk group for diphtheria incidence based on the serological testing of anti-diphtheria immunity in indicator groups in Russia in 2013-2016. Material and methods. The analysis of the anti-diphtheria immunity status in the Russian Federation in 4 indicator age groups (30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60 years and older) carried out in 2014-2016 in compared with 2013 (before vaccination) was used as the basis for assessing the efficacy of the next scheduled adult revaccination. Three criteria were used: a decrease in the percentage of unprotected (seronegative) subjects, an increase in the percentage of high serum antibody titers subjects (1:320 or high-er), and the level of actual protection of subjects in each age group (the number of subjects with protective titers of diphtheria an-tibodies). According to serological testing reports of anti-diphtheria immunity, 109,295 sera samples were analyzed. Anti-diphthe-ria antibodies in serum were determined using a passive hemagglutination test. A serum dilution of 1:20 or higher was considered as the protective level of antibodies. Results and discussion. Analysis of serological testing results of anti-diphtheria antitoxic immunity in 2013-2016 showed that the average changes of all criteria for assessing the efficacy of the next scheduled diphtheria revaccination was insignificant in the stud-ied indicator groups of adults in Russia. However, the age groups 50-59 years and 60 years and older showed a higher percentage of seronegative subjects than the other age groups (7.1±0.30% and 10.3±0.42%, respectively). However, since 2013-2016 the ep-idemiological insecurity indicator (10% or more subjects with no antibodies to diphtheria) is recorded annually in 15-25 regions in these age groups, which confirms that they remain risk groups. In 43.4% of all examined individuals from all regions of our country in all indicator groups, there is no improvement in the estimated figures of the next scheduled revaccination efficacy of adults. A significant increase in the percentage of seronegative subjects and a decrease in the percentage of high antibody titers subjects are observed by 2016 in three age groups (30-39, 40-49, and 50-59 years). The highest rates, indicating the absence of the next scheduled revaccination, were recorded in the age group 60 years and older. Conclusion. According to serological testing data, diphtheria revaccination was was poorly performed during the analyzed period in the age groups of 50-59 years and 60 years and older. Consequently, the coverage of the regions of our country conducting proper serological testing (objectively determining the percentage of susceptible to diphtheria subjects) among vaccinated subjects aged 60 and over does not reach 90%. © 2021, Media Sphera Publishing Group.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of burnout and its associations with the work environment among hospital physicians in the Kaunas region, Lithuania. The cross-sectional study was carried out in 2018. The Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) were administered to examine occupational stress and personal, work-related, and client-related burnout among 647 physicians. Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the association between dependent variable burnout and psychosocial environment among physicians, adjusting for potential confounders of age and gender. The prevalence rate of client-related, work-related, and personal burnout was 35.1%, 46.7%, and 44.8%, respectively. High job control, lack of supervisor, coworker support, job demands, and job insecurity were significantly associated with all three sub-dimensions of burnout. High job demands increased the probability of all three burnout dimensions, high job control reduced the probability of work-related, and client-related burnout and high job insecurity increased the probability of client-related burnout. The confirmed associations suggest that optimization of job demands and job control and the improvement of job security would be effective preventive measures in reducing occupational burnout among physicians. © 2020 by the authors.

This study aimed to examine the association of occupation-level automation probability with work stress and workers' health. Methods: We used data from a national survey of 14,948 randomly selected general workers conducted in 2016. Job control and job demand were assessed by the Job Content Questionnaire, and working hours and job insecurity were self-reported. Health outcomes were measured according to burnout and work-related injury or disease. We derived automation probabilities for 38 occupational groups and conducted multilevel analyses to examine the associations between occupation-level automation probability and workers' safety and health after adjusting for psychosocial work conditions. Results: Participants working in jobs with a high probability of automation were more likely to have low job control, higher job insecurity, and work-related injury and disease prevalence; whereas workers in jobs with a low automation probability had higher psychological and physical demands and burnout prevalence. Furthermore, automation probability significantly predicted workers' health after adjustment for demographic characteristics and psychosocial work conditions. Conclusions: Workers with low automation probability jobs may experience work stress other than that captured by traditional measures of job strain. Organizational approaches to improve employment security and psychosocial conditions are essential for workers' safety and health in the context of increasing job automation. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","automation; computerization; health and safety; occupation; psychosocial work stress","Adult; Employment; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multilevel Analysis; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Health; Occupational Injuries; Occupational Stress; Occupations; Prevalence; Probability; Psychosocial Functioning; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Workplace; adult; employment; female; human; job stress; male; middle aged; multilevel analysis; occupation; occupational accident; occupational disease; occupational health; prevalence; probability; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; social psychology; Taiwan; workplace","W.-J.

However, the analysis of the global dryland areas, using new climate data, suggests a total of ~ 45% of the Earth's terrestrial area, almost 7 mil km2 more than initially estimated. This new spatial dimension involves a wide range of environmental issues, some of which have yet to be associated with these critical global systems. This paper primarily aims to accurately quantify the global, continental and national extent of drylands by using a high-resolution climate database presently available at global level. Also, based on relevant scientific literature, this approach attempts to briefly highlight the main environmental issues (natural and anthropogenic) of the major continental and regional dryland areas. In this respect, special attention was given to the land degradation processes (water and wind erosion, vegetation degradation, salinization, soil compaction and nutrient loss), as it is known to be the main environmental perturbation in almost all dryland systems. Research shows that, given the fact that Africa and Asia have the most extensive dryland systems on Earth (each of them has almost 23 mil km2, or ~ 15% of the global land area), these continents are especially threatened by major environmental perturbations (desertification, in addition to other ecological and climatic disturbances such as drought, dust storms, heat waves, water stress, extreme rainfall events, wildfire, dzud, or disease emergence), which are currently affecting 46 African states (37% of the 126 states affected by aridity worldwide) and 38 Asian states (30%). Given this context, anthropogenic systems are indirectly severely threatened by the crisis generated by soaring poverty, food insecurity, population migration, and escalating conflicts and regional political instability. Moreover, in the current context of large-scale aridity identified at high latitudes, another critical threat reviewed was the cryosphere's destabilization, which can potentially accelerate climate warming by means of positive feedback mechanisms that can be triggered in the global climate system. In this respect, a major concern is attributed to permafrost melting that, against the background of a significant expansion in the terrestrial northern hemisphere (in Russia, Alaska and Canada), can generate a massive acceleration of climate warming due to the potential release of large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which are currently stored in these frozen soils in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Dryland systems; Environmental issues; Global extent; Land degradation","arid region; climate change; environmental issue; feedback mechanism; global change; global warming; land degradation","","","Elsevier B.V.","00128252","","","","English","Earth Sci.

From a macroeconomic point of view, the food security is a basic component of the social, economic, and national security of a state. The paper proposes a comparative presentation and analysis of Romania and the Republic of Moldova from the perspective of the main food security indicators. Although there are important differences between the two countries in providing food for the population, there are also common issues specific to food security. In the analysis, specific data on food production and consumption, natural resources, demographic changes, consumer habits, dependence of the domestic import market in the two neighboring countries were considered. In recent years, the agrifood production conditions and natural resources in the two analysed countries have been affected by economic developments, inappropriate economic measures or by various land restructuring activities. The main criteria for the comparative analysis of food security for the two countries were food availability, price volatility, agricultural production, food imports, the share of food costs in the income of the population. The lack of coherent strategies dedicated to food agriculture and food security, the incoherence of decisions, the rapid changes in the structure of the agricultural sector and the local food industries, in trade, as well as in globalization and trade liberalization, lead to rapid changes in the consumers' needs and demands on the food's quality and safety, food security, nutrition, legislation and control. Although both countries are confronted with the dependence of the import national food market, Romania's membership in the European Economic Area can reduce the impact of food insecurity. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).","Differences; Food security; Republic of Moldova; Romania; Similarities","","","Soliman K.S.","International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA","","978-099985512-6","","","English","Proc.

In Guatemala, acute food insecurity reaches alarming levels when the usual dry period during the bimodal rainy seasons is extended or starts earlier than expected. Drought has a slow-onset which theoretically leaves sufficient lead-time for addressing impacts on food security. In practice, emergency response to drought is often reactive and arrives late, starting when the crisis is already evolving. Climate services and food security information systems are key ingredients for integrated climate risk and food security management worldwide. In Guatemala, stakeholders broadly agree on the usefulness of this type of information for decision-making and direct significant efforts towards improving information availability and quality. But the impact of agro-climatic and food security information on decisions is ad hoc or not systematic. Through a mix of qualitative, ethnographic, and participatory methods, we investigated why this situation occurs. We found that different aspects lead to this phenomenon: the impact of drought on food security is mediated by different socio-economic, political, and institutional factors that tend to differ strongly between regions or even communities across the country. This puts special requirements on information provision for decision-making. Information use patterns can be explained by technical, data-related aspects as reliability, timeliness, or accessibility. But only by considering the institutional and organizational context we get a complete understanding on what frames the information-use patterns in climate and food security management in Guatemala. Our research shows that investments in technical aspects of data provision and infrastructure for increased climate and food security management need to address institutional and organizational challenges in order to be effective. © 2020","Climate risk management; Drought; Food security; Institutional analysis; Seasonal hunger","","A.

However, previous studies have mainly focused on restructuring accompanied by massive lay-offs, and the effect of a merger on workers' health is still controversial. This study aims to investigate changes in worker depression and job stress after a merger without downsizing, which is unusual in Korea. Methods: Repeated surveys were done in April 2014, April 2015, and April 2016 involving the participation of 209 subjects. Participants were divided into two groups, which were comprised of blue-collar workers (104) and white-collar workers (105). Sociodemographic characteristics, including age, education level, job tenure, gender, marital status, smoking status, and alcohol consumption, were measured via a survey. To determine the level of depression, the Korean version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was employed, and to investigate job stress, the Korean Occupational Stress Scale-Short Form (KOSS-SF) was used. For statistical analyses, Pearson's chi-square test, the Student's t-test, and repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed. Results: The results showed that depression (CES-D, F[2, 400] = 0.466, p = 0.628) was changed but without significance and job stress (KOSS-SF, F[1.899, 379.831] = 3.192, p = 0.045) were significantly different. The between-group difference in the CES-D score between the blue- and white-collar workers by survey administration time was not statistically significant (F = 0.316, p = 0.574). The interaction between the survey time and occupational group was also not statistically significant (F = 0.967, p = 0.381). The between-group difference in the KOSS-SF total score was not statistically significant (F = 1.132, p = 0.289), and the interaction between the survey administration time and occupational group was also not significant (F = 0.817, p = 0.437). In the job stress subgroup analyses Job insecurity and Lack of reward showed a significant difference by survey administration time. Conclusion: This study showed that a merger without massive downsizing can cause negative health effects such as an changes in depression and increase in job stress. To improve the health of workers, both the immediate negative effects on health, and the long-term effects or their resolution over time should be considered prior to the merger. © 2018 The Author(s).","Depression; Job stress; Restructuring","adult; alcohol consumption; analysis of variance; article; blue collar worker; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; chi square test; controlled study; disease course; education; female; gender; health care personnel; human; job stress; Korea; major clinical study; male; marriage; reward; smoking; student; white collar worker","J.S.

In particular, for adolescents they provide important spaces to meet with their peers, away from parental or school control. In many cities worldwide, public spaces have undergone severe developmental processes, and often a withdrawal from public space is noted. With regard to the opportunities those spaces provide for adolescents, it is necessary to investigate their current meaning for adolescents in a leisure context. In this article, qualitative research methods were used to investigate factors affecting adolescents’ use of public spaces in Vienna, Austria. In total 45 adolescents were interviewed. Results show that public open spaces are not regarded as important leisure spaces, and data reveal a strong retreat to private areas for leisure purposes. Perceived insecurities and fears support these processes and often result in avoidance of public spaces but also the wish for more control by authorities. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescents; avoidance; leisure behaviour; private space; qualitative research methods; urban public space","Austria; Vienna; public space; qualitative analysis; recreational activity; research method; urban area; young population","A.

Cholera and HIV have significant geographic overlap globally, but little is known about the clinical features and risk of cholera among HIV-infected people and their households. Methods: We assessed HIV-affected households originally recruited for a randomized controlled trial of food supplements. We assessed for correlation between household and individual factors and reported history of cholera since 2010 using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: There were 352 HIV-infected household members, 32 with reported history of medically attended cholera, and 1968 other household members, 55 with reported history of medically attended cholera. Among HIV-infected individuals in this study, no variables correlated with reported history of cholera in univariable analyses. Among all household members, known HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.75; 95% CI, 2.43-5.79; P < .0001), source of income in the household (AOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.05-3.15; P = .034), time required to fetch water (AOR, 1.07 per 5-minute increase; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P = .015), and severe household food insecurity (AOR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.25-8.34; P = .016) were correlated with reported history of cholera in a multivariable analysis. Conclusions: Known HIV infection, source of household income, time required to fetch water, and severe household food insecurity were independently associated with reported history of medically attended cholera in HIV-affected households in rural Haiti. Further research is required to better understand the interactions between HIV and cholera. © The Author(s) 2018.","Cholera; Co-infection; Food security; Haiti; HIV","sulfadoxine plus trimethoprim; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; cholera; clinical feature; controlled study; dietary supplement; female; follow up; food assistance; food insecurity; food security; Haiti; household; household income; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; morbidity; mortality; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; self report; water supply; water treatment","A.

Thus, this study aimed to explore the AST-depression association among adolescents aged 12–15 years from 26 low- and middleincome countries (LMICs). Data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey were analyzed in 51,702 adolescents [mean (SD) age 13.8 (1.0) years; 49.3% boys). Both depressive symptoms and AST were assessed by a single question self-reported measure, respectively. Participants who reported having 5 days or above were considered as AST. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (accounting for sampling weights) was performed while controlling for gender, age, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and food insecurity, and a countrywide meta-analysis was undertaken. The prevalence of depressive symptoms and AST were 30.1% and 37.0%, respectively. Compared with those not having AST, adolescents with AST were less likely to have self-reported depressive symptoms (OR = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.85-0.93) regardless of gender. Countrywide meta-analysis demonstrated that having AST versus not having AST was associated with 12% lower odds for depressive symptoms (OR = 0.88; 95%CI: 0.82-0.94) but with a moderate between-country heterogeneity (I2 = 59.0%). Based on large samples of adolescents from LMICs, it would be expected that AST may play a critical role in preventing adolescent depression worldwide. However, it is necessary to consider more country-specific factors when implementing AST-related mental health interventions. Future studies should adopt the solid study design to confirm or negate our research findings. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

An updated understanding of the causes of mood disorders and their consequences in late life could guide interventions for this underrecognized and undertreated problem. We undertook a population-based analysis to quantify the prevalence of mood disorders in late life in Ontario, Canada, and to identify potential risk factors and consequences. Method: Individuals aged 65 or older participating in 4 cycles of a nationally representative survey were included. Self-report of a diagnosed mood disorder was used as the outcome measure. Using linked administrative data, we quantified associations between mood disorder and potential risk factors such as demographic/socioeconomic factors, substance use, and comorbidity. We also determined associations between mood disorders and 5-year outcomes including health service utilization and mortality. Results: The prevalence of mood disorders was 6.1% (4.9% among males, 7.1% among females). Statistically significant associations with mood disorders included younger age, female sex, food insecurity, chronic opioid use, smoking, and morbidity. Individuals with mood disorders had increased odds of all consequences examined, including placement in long-term care (adjusted odds ratio [OR] =2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71 to 3.02) and death (adjusted OR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.63). Conclusions: Mood disorders in late life were strongly correlated with demographic and social/behavioral factors, health care use, institutionalization, and mortality. Understanding these relationships provides a basis for potential interventions to reduce the occurrence of mood disorders in late life and their consequences. © The Author(s) 2020.","aging; epidemiology; mood disorders","Aged; Female; Humans; Independent Living; Male; Mood Disorders; Ontario; Prevalence; Risk Factors; antidepressant agent; opiate; aged; Article; association; bipolar depression; cause of death; clinical assessment; community dwelling person; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; demography; disease association; dysthymia; female; food insecurity; groups by age; health care utilization; health survey; human; life; long term care; major clinical study; male; mania; mood disorder; morbidity; mortality rate; Ontario; outcome assessment; population; prevalence; risk assessment; risk factor; self report; sex difference; smoking; socioeconomics; substance use; very elderly; independent living; mood disorder; prevalence; risk factor","R.H.

Undernutrition is an important contributor to poor linear growth, stunting, which affects over 149 million children <5 years of age worldwide, one-third of whom live in India. Over 49 million children are wasted; yet globally, there are also 40 million overweight children. Up-to-date data on the magnitude and distribution of micronutrient malnutrition globally and in many countries are lacking. Anemia has been used as a proxy for micronutrient malnutrition; yet anemia, like stunting, has a complex etiology and numerous nonnutritional as well as nutritional causes. Undernutrition, specifically stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiency increasingly coexist with overweight, but accurate data to assess the extent to which these co-exist in countries, households, and individuals and the factors that predict it are scarce. Recent analyses in several countries suggest that there is substantial variability within and among regions in the prevalence and determinants of malnutrition. More and better data that can be used to tailor policies and programs to local contexts are urgently needed if we are to accelerate progress toward addressing malnutrition in all its forms. © 2020 © 2020 Nestlé Nutrition Institute, Switzerland/S.

The analysis of gait parameters can be used to assess the influence of macular degeneration on gait. This study examines the effect of macular degeneration on gait using inertial sensor based 3D spatio-temporal gait parameters. We acquired gait data from 21 young and healthy subjects during a 40 m obstacle walk. All subjects had to perform the gait trial with and without macular degeneration simulation glasses. The order of starting with or without glasses alternated between each subject in order to test for training effects. Multiple 3D spatio-temporal gait parameters were calculated for the normal vision as well as the impaired vision groups. The parameters trial time, stride time, stride time coefficient of variation (CV), stance time, stance time CV, stride length, cadence, gait velocity and angle at toe off showed statistically significant differences between the two groups. Training effects were visible for the trials which started without vision impairment. Inter-group differences in the gait pattern occurred due to an increased sense of insecurity related with the loss of visual acuity from the simulation glasses. In summary, we showed that 3D spatio-temporal gait parameters derived from inertial sensor data are viable to detect differences in the gait pattern of subjects with and without a macular degeneration simulation. We believe that this study provides the basis for an in-depth analysis regarding the impact of macular degeneration on gait. © 2016 IEEE.","","Gait; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Models, Biological; Monitoring, Ambulatory; ambulatory monitoring; biological model; classification; devices; gait; human; macular degeneration; pathophysiology; physiology","C.M.

Food insecurity - through pathways such as malnutrition, mental health impact, and high-risk health behaviors - affects the risk of TB disease, treatment failure, and mortality. We searched the literature for studies reporting on the links between food insecurity and TB. In contrast to the well-documented interactions between food insecurity and HIV/AIDS, we found that the association between food insecurity and TB remains largely understudied - this is especially true with regard to non-nutritional correlations. Mental health and behavioral linkages between TB and food insecurity deserve further attention. An improved understanding of the pathways through which food insecurity impacts TB is crucial to inform evidence-based integration of interventions such as psychological counseling, psychiatric care, harm reduction programs, and efforts to address social determinants of disease within current TB programs. © The Author(s) 2019.

Genetic modification is one potential solution, but has yet to achieve worldwide acceptance, particularly for crops such as wheat. Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), a central sugar signal in plants, regulates sucrose use and allocation, underpinning crop growth and development. Here we show that application of a chemical intervention strategy directly modulates T6P levels in planta. Plant-permeable analogues of T6P were designed and constructed based on a 'signalling-precursor' concept for permeability, ready uptake and sunlight-triggered release of T6P in planta. We show that chemical intervention in a potent sugar signal increases grain yield, whereas application to vegetative tissue improves recovery and resurrection from drought. This technology offers a means to combine increases in yield with crop stress resilience. Given the generality of the T6P pathway in plants and other small-molecule signals in biology, these studies suggest that suitable synthetic exogenous small-molecule signal precursors can be used to directly enhance plant performance and perhaps other organism function. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

The West Coast groundfish trawl fishery transitioned to catch shares management in 2011. We use a multi-year dataset from the Pacific Coast Groundfish Social Survey to explore how fishermen’s job attitudes have changed in relation to catch shares management, and the influence this may have on fishing participation decisions. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found that job satisfaction has not significantly changed, whereas job stability and pay satisfaction have improved. We found that job stability, among other demographic items, is related to fishermen’s participation plans in the groundfish fishery. The five-year period following catch shares implementation can be characterized by elevated levels of fishing participation change as fishermen cope with the uncertainty of a new program, and adjust to changes within the fishery—results which may relate to experiences of fishermen in other fisheries transitioning to catch shares. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Fishing behavior; job insecurity; longitudinal; regulatory uncertainty; repeated measures; social impacts","Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; United States; catchability; fishery management; linearity; local participation; numerical model; regulatory approach; trawling; uncertainty analysis","A.

Current treatments differentiate severe acute malnutrition (SAM) from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with different products and programs. This differentiation is complex and costly. The Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) assessed the effectiveness of a simplified, unified SAM/MAM protocol for children aged 6–59 months. Eliminating the need for separate products and protocols could improve the impact of programs by treating children more easily and cost-effectively, reaching more children globally. Methods and findings A cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial compared a combined protocol against standard care in Kenya and South Sudan. Randomization was stratified by country. Combined protocol clinics treated children using 2 sachets of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) per day for those with mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 11.5 cm and/or edema, and 1 sachet of RUTF per day for those with MUAC 11.5 to <12.5 cm. Standard care clinics treated SAM with weight-based RUTF rations, and MAM with ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF). The primary outcome was nutritional recovery. Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness, coverage, defaulting, death, length of stay, and average daily weight and MUAC gains. Main analyses were per-protocol, with intention-to-treat analyses also conducted. The non-inferiority margin was 10%. From 8 May 2017 to 31 March 2018, 2,071 children were enrolled in 12 combined protocol clinics (mean age 17.4 months, 41% male), and 2,039 in 12 standard care clinics (mean age 16.7 months, 41% male). In total, 1,286 (62.1%) and 1,202 (59.0%), respectively, completed treatment; 981 (76.3%) on the combined protocol and 884 (73.5%) on the standard protocol recovered, yielding a risk difference of 0.03 (95% CI −0.05 to 0.10, p = 0.52; per-protocol analysis, adjusted for country, age, and sex). The amount of ready-to-use food (RUTF or RUSF) required for a child with SAM to reach full recovery was less in the combined protocol (122 versus 193 sachets), and the combined protocol cost US$123 less per child recovered (US$918 versus US$1,041). There were 23 (1.8%) deaths in the combined protocol arm and 21 (1.8%) deaths in the standard protocol arm (adjusted risk difference 95% CI −0.01 to 0.01, p = 0.87). There was no evidence of a difference between the protocols for any of the other secondary outcomes. Study limitations included contextual factors leading to defaulting, a combined multi-country power estimate, and operational constraints. Conclusions Combined treatment for SAM and MAM is non-inferior to standard care. Further research should focus on operational implications, cost-effectiveness, and context (Asia versus Africa; emergency versus food-secure settings).

The alarming growth in population vis-à-vis current food production is expected to increase the global food insecurity levels. Inter alia, cellular agriculture – an incipient technology – is being considered as a potential alternative to cater for the growing demand for food and nutrition. The technology aims to develop edible agricultural products including meat with reduced environmental footprint against conventional farm production. In this context, an attempt has been made to review the progress of cellular agriculture research in four decades (1981–2020) through a bibliometric analysis and to suggest a roadmap for future research. The study sourced data from the Web of Science during October 2020. Using keywords, the database showed 212 searches pertaining to cellular agriculture from 135 journals worldwide. Of the journals, seven had at least five published articles and 33 had two articles each. Subsequently, the bibliographic coupling among the identified journals was carried out. It is found that the Journals: Appetite, Meat Science, and Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics had the largest circles corresponding to their respective number of publications coupled with notable linkages with other journals. Also, a detailed analysis was performed on categories, growth trend, keywords, institutions, regions and leading researchers of cellular agriculture. The findings indicate that the Appetite Journal followed by the Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics had published a significant percentage of articles on cellular agriculture, and Environmental Science and Technology was identified as the highly cited journal. The USA, England and the Netherlands were identified as the progressive regions in cellular agriculture research. The bibliometric analysis points to sluggish progress in cellular agriculture research and production despite its potential benefits. Future research should focus on the cost-effectiveness of the technology, consumer willingness to buy, development of food safety protocols on its merit and regional policy governance coupled with popularising its paybacks in the context of ensuring food security. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bibliometrics; Cellular agriculture; Cultured meat; Insect-based meat; Plant-based meat; Scientometrics","agriculture; appetite; article; bibliometrics; consumer; cost effectiveness analysis; drug safety; England; environmental science; ethics; food industry; food insecurity; food safety; food security; human; insect; meat substitute; Netherlands; nonhuman; Web of Science","J.

Background: Surgical site infection has been a cause of concern worldwide and contributes to the greatest number of hospital readmission occurrences. Health professionals must understand the meaning of these readmissions for the individual, as an understanding of these exclusive experiences improves the quality of surgical care. Design: Qualitative research based on the existential phenomenology of Martin Heidegger. Method: Eleven individuals who were readmitted because of surgical site infection participated in the study. The testimonials were obtained over an 11-month period in 2014–2015 based on the following leading question: What has it been like for you to be readmitted because of orthopaedic surgical site infection? The phenomenological analysis identified the sentiment units of the testimonials and their interrelation, revealing the meanings. Results: The revealed contents were fear and insecurity of the unknown, frustration, and the sense of time passing them by and being unable to live their lives. The individuals felt neglected, and they experienced their social relationality as impaired and sometimes approaching a breakdown. The patients connected with God as an attempt to avoid complications and death. Conclusion: We urge healthcare professionals to deepen their knowledge of the dimensions of care by developing competencies that consider the subjectivity of experiences of the health–disease process. When the only listening that takes place is qualified listening, the professional's attitudes compromise his or her ability to provide true care, which transcends the knowledge of doing and reaches the knowledge of doing with sensitivity. Relevance to clinical practice: Nursing care requires an attitude that considers the patient as more than a carrier of illness and should not be limited to what is described and prescribed, although the latter cannot be excluded in an organisational point of view. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","infection control; nursing; patients' experience; phenomenology; surgical nursing","Female; Hermeneutics; Humans; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Patient Readmission; Qualitative Research; Surgical Wound Infection; Treatment Outcome; adverse effects; female; hermeneutics; hospital readmission; human; male; orthopedic surgery; qualitative research; statistics and numerical data; Surgical Wound Infection; treatment outcome","L.M.

Objective: To compare the prevalence of fast-food consumption among young adolescents in LMICs. Methods: We used data from the most recent Global School-Based Student Health Survey (2009–2015), which had been collected using a standardized questionnaire. The weighted prevalence and 95% confidential intervals of fast-food consumption were calculated overall and in subgroups stratified by age, sex, and nutritional status. The pooled overall and regional estimates were obtained using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. The associated risk factors for fast-food consumption were explored using logistic regression analysis. Results: Our study comprised 153,496 young adolescents (46.90% boys) from 54 LMICs. Overall, approximately 55.2% (51.3–59.1%) of the adolescents consumed fast food at least 1 day per week, and 10.3% (8.3–12.4%) did so 4–7 days per week. The prevalence of fast-food consumption 4–7 days per week was lowest in the Americas (8.3%; 6.7–9.9%) and highest in Southeast Asia (17.7%; 2.3–33.2%). At a country level, the prevalence was lowest in Pakistan (1.5%; 1.0–2.0%) and highest in Thailand (43.3%; 40.4–46.1%). Furthermore, in subgroups stratified by nutritional status, the prevalence was lowest in the obesity group (6.6%; 4.5–8.7%). Factors such as age, sex, BMI, food insecurity, fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, soft-drink consumption, smoking, physical activity level, and sedentary behavior level were found to be correlated with fast-food consumption. Conclusions: The identified high prevalence of fast-food consumption among young adolescents in LMICs indicates the urgent need to prioritize the implementation of healthy-diet promotion programs to improve adolescent health in these countries. © 2020 The Author(s).

We have to prepare ourselves according to the rapid changes of ICT in fast changing environment. If we fail to face these challenges and demands, we would easily fall into the trap of stress. Stress is a negative consequence of modern living. People are stressed due to overwork, job insecurity, health related issues, multiple responsibilities and increase in pace of life. Pascal (1992) defined stress in terms of perceived environmental situation which threatens the gratification of needs. The present study is an attempt to explore the research productivity on stress during the time period of 2009-2018. The data was collected from Web of Science which is one of the largest citations and abstracting database, owned by Thomson Reuters. The main findings of the study revealed that there is a growing trend of publications during the time period of 2009-2018. Majority of the publication has been produced in the year 2018 (123,822; 13.61%) and the least number of publications recorded in the year 2009 (63,321; 6.95%). The leading document type in which research has been published consists of journal articles (793,868; 87.20%) and USA (248,695; 27.31%) being the most productive nation on stress research output worldwide. In language analysis, English is found to be the dominant language (887,350; 97.40%) in overall publications. The most prolific authors on stress research output are Wang (3,929; 0.43%), Zhang (3,658;0.40%) and Liu (3,276; 0.36%). The most commonly used journal in which maximum research output has been published is PLOS One. At last, the Chinese Academy of Science, Harvard University and the Russian Academy of Science are found to be the most productive institutions contributing to the stress related database. © 2020.

The objectives of the study were to investigate the perspectives of those involved with existing physical activity programmes on optimising recruitment, sustainability and scalability of physical activity programmes for adults aged 50 years and over. Methods The study was conducted in Ireland’s Midwest region, where community-based physical activity programmes are delivered to groups by state-funded Local Sports Partnerships. Programme attendees, physical activity professionals and community advocates were recruited. One-to-one interviews and focus groups were conducted in 2018, recorded, transcribed and analysed by an interdisciplinary team experienced in qualitative research. Over a series of meetings, a thematic approach was used to code and analyse the transcripts, categorising data into higher order codes, themes and overarching themes with the purpose of making meaning of the data. Twenty-nine people participated in four focus groups and 18 participated in one-to-one interviews. Findings Data analysis produced three overarching themes. “Age appropriate” explains how communication and the environment should be adapted to the needs of adults aged 50 years and older. “Culture and connection” refer to the interplay of individual and social factors that influence participation, including individual fears and insecurities, group cohesion and added value beyond the physical gains in these programmes. “Roles and partnerships” outlines how key collaborations may be identified and managed and how local ownership is key to success and scalability. Conclusion Successful recruitment, sustainability and scalability require an understanding that the target population has unique needs that must be catered for when planning interventions, communicating messages and choosing personnel. The findings of this study can inform the development of community-based programmes to increase physical activity in adults aged 50 years and older. © 2020 O’Regan et al.

Furthermore, recent studies have reported extensive food insecurity in Iran. Objectives: The present study aimed at defining the levels of food security and investigating its correlation with socioeconomic factors among pregnant women in city of Rasht (Iran) in 2014. Methods: The present cross sectional study included 420 pregnant women in their 14 to 42 weeks of pregnancy. The sampling method was convenience, and the data were collected using demographic-obstetrics, socioeconomic factors, and food security status questionnaires through face-to-face interviews. The data were analyzed using SPSS 19. Results: The results revealed that 30.9% of the pregnant women had food insecurity (19.6% had food insecurity without hunger, 8.9% had moderate hunger, and 2.4% had severe hunger), while 69.1% had complete food security. Food security was significantly correlated with socioeconomic status of the family, residence area, husband’s occupation, number of employed family members, monthly income, and monthly food cost (P value < 0.001). The results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that husband’s occupation (OR = 1.28), economic status (OR = 1.53), and residence area (OR = 1.43) had increasing effects on food insecurity. Conclusions: Considering the high prevalence of food insecurity among pregnant women and its adverse impact on the mother and the fetus, it seems necessary to investigate the level of food security in women during prenatal care and to support pregnant women with food insecurity in particular. © 2017, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.","Food security; Pregnantwomen; Socioeconomic factors","controlled study; cross-sectional study; data analysis software; family; female; fetus; food insecurity; food security; human; hunger; interview; Iran; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; obstetrics; occupation; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal care; prevalence; questionnaire; sampling; social status; socioeconomics; statistical significance","M.

Institutional economics is a socio-cultural discipline and policy science, resting on two bedrock principles: (1) economies are best understood through analyses grounded in an appreciation of history, real-world institutions, and socioeconomic interrelations; and (2) the fundamental aim of economics must be to make the world a better place. Institutionalism originated in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century; coalesced as part of the mainstream in economics after World War I; made major contributions to the New Deal, Great Society, and more recent progressive initiatives; and was ahead of the curve in warning about and addressing the global financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-2009. Written during the COVID-19 pandemic and against the backdrop of serious worldwide problems such as worker insecurity, income inequality, and global warming, this book aims to point the way forward by introducing some of institutionalism’s most important perspectives (including, for example, post-Keynesian institutionalism and feminist institutionalism) and methods (ranging from “storytelling” to system dynamics). © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Charles J.

Methods: This study used data from a re-census collected between October 2014 and December 2014.15,159 household members in thirteen kebeles of the Dabat Health and Demographic surveillance system were included. The outcome variables of the study were food insecurity and coping strategies. Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) was used to assess food insecurity. If food insecurity was found, families were asked about coping mechanisms used. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to identify socio-demographic determinants of reducing amount and frequency of meal as a coping mechanism in response to food insecurity. Result: Of the 15,159 households surveyed, 6671 (44.01%) reported the presence of a food insecurity in their household. Decreasing meal frequency and portions (3733 (55.96%)), borrowing money and food (2542 (38.11%)), and receiving food and money aid (1779 (26.67%)) were among the major coping strategies used by the households. Urban dwellers (AOR 2.07: 95% CI 1.74, 2.46), mid-altitude (weyina-dega) and high-land (dega) dwellers (AOR 2.46: 95% CI 2.08, 2.92 and AOR 1.22 95% CI 1.08, 1.38 respectively), and not married persons (AOR 1.60: 95% CI 1.07, 2.39) were more likely to consume less when faced with a food insecurity (using reducing amount and frequency of meal as a coping strategy). Conclusion: Households in the study area experienced a very high rate of food insecurity. Decreasing meal frequency and portions was the primary coping mechanism used by the households. Due to the severe insecurity of food in their household, many people chose to reduce the amount and frequency of their meal in order to prolong the small amount of food in their house. This finding indicates a high risk for undernourishment which can exacerbate the burden of malnutrition and related diseases in the region. © 2018 The Author(s).","Borrowing; Coping; Ethiopia; Food aid; Food insecurity; Reducing amount and frequency of meal","","A.T.

Certain economies, especially regions with low agricultural yield, rely on food imports and are susceptible to food insecurity due to potential negative disruptions to the global food network. These rising complexities in global food networks result in increased dependencies between countries, rendering the overall network extremely vulnerable. Local disruptions to production levels could entirely cripple the food network and lead to longterm reduced food access worldwide. Understanding the impact of different disruptions and potential mitigation strategies at the country level on agricultural supply chains becomes important in the analysis of the global allocation of agricultural products. We model a stochastic resource allocation problem with nonlinear connectivity costs to capture trade dynamics between countries. We compare model recommendations to historical trade flow data including coffee import/export between countries, unveiling the value of centralized planning under potential disruption scenarios against the current practices. © 2021 IEEE.","Global Agriculture Networks; Stochastic Optimization; Supply Chain and Risk","Agricultural products; Chemical contamination; International trade; Optimization; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Agricultural supply chains; Agricultural yields; Data driven; Food insecurity; Global agriculture network; Globalisation; Logistics technologies; Stochastic optimizations; Supply chain and risk; Supply disruption; Supply chains","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166543771-4","","","English","IEEE Int.

However, periodic monitoring of the effectiveness of acaricides has not been fully explored, although such information could contribute to a more effective application, economic analysis and harmful impact on other organisms and environmental contamination. This study investigates the effect of cypermethrine (CYM), deltamethrin, trichlorphon + dimethylester, ivermectin (IVM) and fipronil on natural infestations of ticks in goats. The in vivo quantitative assessment of four tick genera i.e. Hyalomma, Rhipicephalus, Ixodes and Haemaphysalis revealed that both CYM and IVM treated groups resulted in significantly lower (P<0.05) tick counts relative to other compounds and controls on all post-treated days. The maximum reduction in the mean number of ticks in the CYM and IVM treated group was recorded from days 3 to 4, followed by complete shedding of ticks on day 5. However, deltamethrin, trichlorphon + dimethylester and fipronil showed 100% efficacy on the sixth day. In-vitro efficacy trials showed a 100% tick’s mortality based upon the use of fipronil (0.25 g/100 mL) within the 18th h in the post-treated group, while deltamethrin, trichlorphon + dimethylester and CYM were ranked 2nd, 3rd and 5th based on their 100% efficacy within 24-33 h, 33-42 h and 39-48 h, respectively. The investigation has shown that tested acaricides varied in their efficacy to reduce the tick infestation and further experiments on different formulations of the other members of the major acaricidal classes need to be standardized. © 2021, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

The present study aimed to examine the impact of family income and conditional cash transfers on changes in household FI status in a highly vulnerable municipality in Northeast Brazil.Design: A population-based longitudinal cohort study among families in a municipality in the semi-arid area in Northeast Brazil (2011 and 2014). FI was estimated with the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale (EBIA). The effects of family income and cash transfer on changes in FI were estimated using logistic regression models and the population-attributable risk fraction.Setting: Households in Cuité, Paraíba, Brazil.Participants: Household respondents interviewed in 2011 (n 358) and 2014 (n 326).Results: There was a reduction in FI prevalence of 17·5 % across time; 24·5 % of families who were food insecure in 2011 became food secure in 2014. After adjustment, families that did not experience an increase in their total household income or a reduction in the cash transfer amount were at increased risk of persistent FI across time. If the cash transfer programme had not been in place, about 10 % of the families that switched from food insecure to food secure across time would have remained in FI instead.Conclusions: The decrease of FI occurred in an area of extreme climatic and social vulnerability. These changes were more related to the cash transfer than the increase in family income over time. © 2019 The Authors.","Brazil; Cash transfer; Food insecurity; Poverty","Brazil; Cities; Climate; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Characteristics; Food Assistance; Food Insecurity; Humans; Income; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Rural Population; Urban Population; Vulnerable Populations; adult; article; attributable risk; Brazil; cohort analysis; family income; female; food insecurity; household income; human; longitudinal study; male; poverty; prevalence; risk assessment; Brazil; city; climate; cross-sectional study; economics; family size; food assistance; food insecurity; income; longitudinal study; rural population; statistical model; urban population; vulnerable population","P.A.

Early detection of poor adjustment and interventions to facilitate positive adaptation within these communities is a critical global public health priority. A growing literature points to challenges within the post-migration context as key determents of poor mental health. Aims: The current meta-analysis evaluated the association between daily stressors and poor mental health among these populations. Method: A systematic search in PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science identified relevant studies from inception until the end of 2018. Effect sizes (correlation coefficients) were pooled using Fisher's Z transformation and reported with 95% confidence intervals. Moderator and mediator analyses were conducted. The protocol is available in PROSPERO [CRD42018081207]. Results: Analysis of 59 eligible studies (n = 17,763) revealed that daily stressors were associated with higher psychiatric symptoms (Zr=0.126–0.199, 95% CI=0.084–0.168, 0.151–0.247, p<0.001) and general distress (Zr=0.542, 95% CI=0.332–0.752, p<0.001). Stronger effect sizes were observed for mixed daily stressors relative to subjective, interpersonal, and material daily stressors, and for general distress relative to posttraumatic stress symptoms and general well-being. Effect sizes were also stronger for children and adolescents relative to adults. Daily stressors fully mediated the associations of prior trauma with post-migration anxiety, depressive, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides a synthesis of existing research on the role of unfavorable everyday life experiences and their associations with poor mental health among conflict-affected forced migrants. Routine assessment and intervention to reduce daily stressors can prevent and reduce psychiatric morbidity in these populations. © 2019","Anxiety; Depression; Everyday life; Forced migrants; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Refugees","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Humans; Life Change Events; Mental Health; Refugees; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Transients and Migrants; anxiety disorder; clinical evaluation; conflict; cost effectiveness analysis; depression; disease association; distress syndrome; food insecurity; human; human relation; leisure; mental health; mental stress; meta analysis; migrant; outcome assessment; personal experience; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; psychological well-being; quality control; Review; sleep quality; social behavior; systematic review; adolescent; adult; child; life event; mental health; migration; posttraumatic stress disorder; refugee","W.K.

A widely used illicit drug in Iraq in recent years is Captagon, which is second only to methamphetamine. It is also popular in Middle East especially in Syria, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It is the brand name of chemical compound Fenethylline, and it is a derivative substantial of amphetamines. It is amphetamine coupled with theophylline via an alkyl chain. We used a rapid, low-cost colorimetric assay for sensitive and visual detection of Captagon in real human samples using a Captagon-specific aptamer as the recognition element and original gold nanoparticles as indicators. The method indicated that the presence of Captagon resulted in gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) solution's color change from purple to blue. The method was rapid and also worked well in human urine samples, blood and hair. Colorimtric detection of Captagon could be measured either visually or by measurement of the absorbance intensity ratios at 650 and 520 nm, respectively. It worked in the 2 μM to 50 μM concentration range. Selectivity of captgon detection method was also investigated with illicit and licit drugs, which revealed that an obvious change both in absorption spectra and in visual color was observed upon the addition of Captagon, whereas slight and negligible change occurred in the presence of any examined drugs with the similar concentration as Captagon. Our findings presented that hair was a good example for detection of drug history of Captagon and other illicit drugs compared with urine and blood, which is believed to represent a widely applicable aptamer-based detection system. © Abbas Alfadly, Ali Abdulwahid, and Afrodet Saleh.

To improve worldwide energy security and supply, new policies regarding renewable energy and new infrastructure should be developed. Since 2006, Indonesia's dependency on oil imports has been increasing significantly. Recent policies on renewable energy have been issued to cope with the issue. This study focuses on describing the feasibility of using biogas for energy production in Indonesia. Biogas contains 50–70% methane and 30–50% carbon dioxide and has a calorific value of 21–24 MJ/Nm3. Therefore, it can be potentially altered to contain 97% methane prior to injecting into natural gas networks. The prospective derivation of biogas from cattle, pig, and chicken waste in Indonesia could reach approximately 79 Trillion Watt-hours (TWh). In order to use biogas for power generation, two scenarios were created. The electricity demand, the environmental impact and the reduction of GHG emissions were considered over the next 20 years. The first scenario depended on current energy policy and the second scenario depended on biogas as a substitute for the fossil fuel that is still used for generating power. The carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were estimated for each scenario.

However, risk factors for suicidal thoughts might change across cultures and contexts. We aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal thought among adults in a southern Brazilian city. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study used a multistage sampling procedure to evaluated individuals with 18 years or more, living in a southern city in Brazil. We collected suicidal thought using a question from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. In addition, we collected information on sociodemographic, behavioral, and health variables, through a questionnaire using standardized and validated instruments. We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) using Poisson Regression models with robust adjustment of the variance. Results: We collected information from 1295 individuals, 6.6% were positive for suicidal thought. In multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with suicidal thoughts included: being a woman, poor, reporting current tobacco use, having household food insecurity, having three or more morbidities, being in the upper tertile of the stress scores, having had a depression diagnostic in the last year and sadness. Limitations: We cannot say that the associations found are causal. Suicidal thoughts were assessed from a single question. Conclusion: Suicidal thought is a prevalent condition, most likely associated with being a woman, having worst socioeconomic conditions, a poorer health, a higher stress, using tobacco and having depression and/or sadness. © 2019","Brazil; Epidemiology; Mental health; Suicidality; Suicide","Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Brazil; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adult; Article; Brazil; cross-sectional study; depression; exposure variable; female; food insecurity; groups by age; high risk population; household; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; multivariate analysis; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; sadness; sampling; socioeconomics; suicidal ideation; susceptible population; tobacco use; adolescent; age distribution; disease predisposition; epidemiology; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; sex ratio; suicide attempt; young adult","C.

Unfortunately, what has manifested as a result of this pandemic is a magnified view of the inequalities that exist for many historically marginalized groups in our society. We may all be experiencing the same storm but clearly, we are in very different boats trying to navigate these gale force winds. Individuals who live with disabilities, struggle with income and food insecurities, racialized folks as well as those who are part of the LGBT2Q+ community, may be at an even higher risk for further marginalization during this time of uncertainty and upheaval. Women have been significantly and disproportionately impacted compared to men in many aspects and shines light on how intersectionality further complicates and denies access to these folks. One significant observation is that the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated measures restricting movement and limiting physical contact with others have significantly altered the daily routines of many Canadians. Adapting to lifestyle changes such as working from home, job loss, homeschooling children, providing care for family, and social isolation is challenging and poses a significant risk to one's mental health. The World Health Organization has placed women at seventy per cent of health and social-service workers worldwide which places them at the forefront of the crisis and at greater risk of exposure to the virus. For many women, online learning may be how they position themselves to consume learning, be competitive in the labour market while carrying the responsibilities of childcare, family care, and the unpaid labour in the household. © IMSCI 2020.All right reserved.","COVID-19; Family status; Gender; Intersectionality; Online learning; Violence; Women","Employment; Health risks; Home health care; Occupational risks; Viruses; Food insecurity; Marginalization; Online learning; Physical contacts; Risk of exposures; Social isolation; Social service; World Health Organization; E-learning","A.

The present study aimed to measure the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of household FI and to explore the association of household FI with anthropometric measures of children and their mothers.Design Cross-sectional survey (2014-2015).Setting Lebanon.Participants Nationally representative sample of Lebanese households with 4-18-year-old-children and their mothers (n 1204).Results FI prevalence (95 % CI), measured using the Arabic-translated, validated Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, was found to be 49·3 (44·0, 54·6) % in the study sample. Mild, moderate and severe FI were found in 7·0 (5·5, 9·2) %, 23·3 (20·1, 26·8) % and 18·9 (14·9, 23·5) % of households, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that low maternal and paternal education, unemployment and crowding were significant correlates of household FI (P<0·05). No significant associations were observed between FI and anthropometric measures of children and their mothers, after adjusting for other socio-economic correlates. Food-insecure households reported various mechanisms to cope with food shortage, such as reducing the number of meals/d (49·6 %), borrowing food (54·4 %), spending savings (34·5 %) and withdrawing children from schools (8·0 %).Conclusions FI exists among a remarkable proportion of Lebanese households with children. Correlates of household FI should be considered when designing social welfare policies and public health programmes to promote more sustainable, resilient and healthier livelihoods among vulnerable individuals. © The Authors 2018.","Correlates; Food (in)security; Households; Lebanon; Prevalence","Adolescent; Anthropometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Crowding; Educational Status; Family Characteristics; Female; Food Supply; Humans; Lebanon; Male; Mothers; Prevalence; Regression Analysis; Unemployment; adolescent; adult; article; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; crowding (area); education; female; food insecurity; household; human; human experiment; human tissue; Lebanon; male; mother; multiple regression; preschool child; prevalence; public health; social welfare; unemployment; anthropometry; catering service; cross-sectional study; educational status; epidemiology; family size; Lebanon; prevalence; regression analysis","N.

This trend will contribute to food insecurity, particularly for some of the most vulnerable regions, by limiting the productivity of crops. Despite its great importance, there is a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of variation in heat tolerance within plant species. Common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, is relatively susceptible to heat stress, which is of concern given its critical role in global food security. Here, we evaluated three genotypes of P. vulgaris belonging to kidney market class under heat and control conditions. The Sacramento and NY-105 genotypes were previously reported to be heat tolerant, while Redhawk is heat susceptible. Results: We quantified several morpho-physiological traits for leaves and found that photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and leaf area all increased under elevated temperatures. Leaf area expansion under heat stress was greatest for the most susceptible genotype, Redhawk. To understand gene regulatory responses among the genotypes, total RNA was extracted from the fourth trifoliate leaves for RNA-sequencing. Several genes involved in the protection of PSII (HSP21, ABA4, and LHCB4.3) exhibited increased expression under heat stress, indicating the importance of photoprotection of PSII. Furthermore, expression of the gene SUT2 was reduced in heat. SUT2 is involved in the phloem loading of sucrose and its distal translocation to sinks. We also detected an almost four-fold reduction in the concentration of free hexoses in heat-treated beans. This reduction was more drastic in the susceptible genotype. Conclusions: Overall, our data suggests that while moderate heat stress does not negatively affect photosynthesis, it likely interrupts intricate source-sink relationships. These results collectively suggest a physiological mechanism for why pollen fertility and seed set are negatively impacted by elevated temperatures. Identifying the physiological and transcriptome dynamics of bean genotypes in response to heat stress will likely facilitate the development of varieties that can better tolerate a future of elevated temperatures. © 2019 The Author(s).","Common bean; Heat stress; Photosynthesis; Source-sink relationships; Transcriptome","Climate Change; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Genotype; Nutrients; Phaseolus; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Seeds; Sequence Analysis; Stress, Physiological; Sucrose; Temperature; sucrose; ABA4 gene; Article; controlled study; gene expression; genotype; heat stress; heat tolerance; HSP21 gene; LHCB4 3 gene; morphological trait; nonhuman; Phaseolus vulgaris; photosynthesis; plant gene; plant leaf; plant stoma; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; seed set; stomatal conductance; SUT2 gene; temperature measurement; climate change; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetics; metabolism; Phaseolus; physiological stress; physiology; plant seed; sequence analysis; temperature","A.

Immigrants represent a significant proportion of older Canadians. Social isolation is common among older adults and has many negative consequences, including limited community and civic participation, increased income insecurity, and increased risk of elder abuse. Additional factors such as the social, cultural, and economic changes that accompany migration, language differences, racism, and ageism heighten older immigrants' vulnerability to social isolation. Objective: This mixed-methods sequential (qualitative-quantitative) study seeks to clarify older immigrants' social needs, networks, and support and how these shape their capacity, resilience, and independence in aging well in Ontario. Methods: Theoretically, our research is informed by an intersectionality perspective and an ecological model, allowing us to critically examine the complexity surrounding multiple dimensions of social identity (eg, gender and immigration) and how these interrelate at the micro (individual and family), meso (community), and macro (societal) levels in diverse geographical settings. Methodologically, the project is guided by a collaborative, community-based, mixed-methods approach to engaging a range of stakeholders in Toronto, Ottawa, Waterloo, and London in generating knowledge. The 4 settings were strategically chosen for their diversity in the level of urbanization, size of community, and the number of immigrants and immigrant-serving organizations. Interviews will be conducted in Arabic, Mandarin, and Spanish with older women, older men, family members, community leaders, and service providers. The study protocol has received ethics approval from the 4 participating universities. Results: Quantitative and qualitative data collection is ongoing. The project is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada. Conclusions: Comparative analyses of qualitative and quantitative data within and across sites will provide insights about common and unique factors that contribute to the well-being of older immigrants in different regions of Ontario. Given the comprehensive approach to incorporating local knowledge and expert contributions from multilevel stakeholders, the empirical and theoretical findings will be highly relevant to our community partners, help facilitate practice change, and improve the well-being of older men and women in immigrant communities. © Sepali Guruge, Souraya Sidani, Lu Wang, Bharati Sethi, Denise Spitzer, Margaret Walton-Roberts, Ilene Hyman.

Until recently, ""anemia"" was used synonymously with ""iron deficiency anemia (IDA)"" in global health settings. However, only 50% of anemia cases worldwide are IDA. Environmental toxicology studies of anemia risk have generally focused on populations in developed countries, albeit with high exposure to environmental toxicants, such as lead or cadmium. In the developing world, toxicant exposures commonly coexist with other risk factors for anemia. In particular, artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) communities are at risk for dietary methylmercury exposure through contaminated fish consumption, and for anemia due to food insecurity and infectious and chronic diseases. Here, we report analysis of total hair mercury content, hemoglobin, and serum micronutrient levels in children < 12 years of age (N = 83) near ASGM in the Peruvian Amazon. Forty-nine percent (N = 29/59) of those aged < 5 years were anemic (< 11 g/dL) and 52% (N = 12/23) of those aged 5-11 years (< 11.5 g/dL). Few children were stunted, wasted, or micronutrient deficient. Median total hair mercury was 1.18 μg/g (range: 0.06-9.70 μg/g).Wefound an inverse association between total mercury and hemoglobin (β = -0.12 g/dL, P = 0.06) that persisted (β = -0.14 g/dL, P = 0.04) after adjusting for age, sex, anthropometrics, and vitamin B12 in multivariate regression. This study provides preliminary evidence that methylmercury exposure is associated with anemia, which is especially relevant to children living near ASGM. © 2017 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","","Anemia, Iron-Deficiency; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Dietary Exposure; Female; Fishes; Food Contamination; Gold; Hair; Hemoglobins; Humans; Male; Methylmercury Compounds; Micronutrients; Mining; Nutritional Status; Peru; Risk Factors; Seafood; cyanocobalamin; gold; hemoglobin; methylmercury; trace element; hemoglobin; methylmercury derivative; anemia; Article; child; disease association; environmental exposure; female; hair level; hemoglobin blood level; human; major clinical study; male; mercurialism; mining; nutritional deficiency; Peruvian; stunting; analysis; animal; blood; chemistry; deficiency; dietary exposure; fish; food contamination; hair; iron deficiency anemia; metabolism; nutritional status; Peru; preschool child; risk factor; sea food","W.K.

Evidence from the literature suggests that >800 million people worldwide are food insecure. Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) is the largest social safety net of the Government of Bangladesh targeting ultra-poor women to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Objectives: The objective of this study is to explore the factors associated with food security among VGD women in Bangladesh. Methods: A total of 870 women (435/group) participated in the baseline survey and another 800 women (400/group) participated in the endline survey. Participants in the intervention group received monthly rations of 30 kg fortified rice (FFR) and the control group received 30 kg of non-FFR for 12 mo. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to establish both crude and confounder-adjusted relations between the primary outcome and response variables. Written consent was proved by study participants. This study (PR-14091) was approved by the Research Review Committee and Ethical Review Committee. Results: Severe food insecurity in the endline survey decreased from ∼50% to 6.3% in both groups. The hunger scale also improved between the baseline and endline survey. More than 97% of respondents at endline reported no hunger compared with 80% at baseline; only 3% of women in both groups reported moderate hunger at endline. Multivariable regression model showed that ownership of a house and land for agriculture, wealth index (richest quintile), and absence of fever were significantly associated with food security (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our analysis shows that the VGD rice distribution program significantly improves the food security status of vulnerable women; however, ownership of a house and land for agriculture were the most significant factors associated with household food security in VGD program areas of Bangladesh.

Several randomized control studies that found success in preventing the progression to T2D in high-risk populations have identified early and intensive intervention based on an individualized prevention model as the key factor for participant benefit. The global prevalence of both overweight and obesity has now been widely recognized as the major epidemic of the 21st century. Obesity is a major risk factor for the progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and then to T2D. However, not all obese individuals will develop prediabetes or progress to diabetes. Intensive, multicomponent behavioural interventions for overweight and obese adults can lead to weight loss. Diabetes medications, including metformin, GLP-1 agonists, glitazones, and acarbose, can be considered for selected high-risk patients with prediabetes when lifestyle-based programmes are proven unsuccessful. Nutrition education is the cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle. Also, physical activity is an integral part of the prediabetes management plan and one of the main pillars in the prevention of diabetes. Mobile phones, used extensively worldwide, can facilitate communication between health professionals and the general population, and have been shown to be helpful in the prevention of T2D. Universal screening is needed. Noninvasive risk scores should be used in all countries, but they should be locally validated in all ethnic populations focusing on cultural differences around the world. Lifestyle interventions reduce the progression to prediabetes and diabetes. Nevertheless, many questions still need to be answered.

The economic, emotional and human cost of suicidal behaviour to individuals, families, communities and society makes it a serious public health issue. We aim to determine the prevalence and factors associated with self-reported suicidal behaviour (suicidal ideation and attempt) among school going adolescents (13-17 years). Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a nationally representative data for Bhutan namely Global School Based Student Health Survey in 2016 which reports on various dimensions of adolescent health including suicidal behaviour. The survey employed a multistage sampling method to recruit participants aged 13-17 years (n = 5809) from 50 schools (25 each in rural and urban area). The survey used an anonymous self-Administered pre-Tested 84-item questionnaire. Weighted analysis was done. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and adjusted Odds Ratios (aORs) have been presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: A total of 667 (11.6%) adolescents reported considering a suicide attempt whereas 656 (11.3%) reported attempting suicide in the past 12 months. Among those reporting suicidal ideation, 388 (58.6%) reported attempting a suicide and 274 (41.4%) had ideation alone, whereas, 247 (38.9%) reported attempting a suicide without previous ideation. Female sex, food insecurity, physical attack, sexual violence, bullying, feeling of loneliness, low parental engagement, reported worry about lack of sleep, urge to use drugs/alcohol, smokeless tobacco use, drug abuse and parental smoking were the factors associated with suicidal attempt. All these factors except smokeless tobacco use and parental smoking were associated with suicidal ideation. Having helpful/close friends was found to be protective against suicide ideation. Conclusion: Suicidal behaviour among school going adolescents in Bhutan is high and alarming, especially among girls. Bullying, sexual violence, feeling of loneliness and drug abuse were some of the key risk factors identified. It is important to identify these risk factors early and effectively tackle them in order to prevent suicides. It requires a multi-faceted intervention with the support of the children, community, teachers and parents. © 2019 The Author(s).","Adolescent; GSHS; Parental engagement; Sexual violence; Suicidal behaviour","Adolescent; Bhutan; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Schools; Self Report; Students; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; adolescent; Bhutan; epidemiology; female; health survey; human; male; prevalence; psychology; risk factor; school; self report; student; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt","T.

Preterm birth and being born small for gestational age (SGA) are major causes of adverse neonatal outcomes worldwide. To reduce preterm birth and infants born SGA, it is important to understand which women are most at risk and how risk varies within countries. There are few studies estimating the prevalence and risk factors for these conditions in Haiti, particularly in rural regions. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant women at a rural tertiary care centre in Haiti from May to December 2017. We collected data during interviews and from the medical record. We built multivariable models to identify risk factors for preterm birth and being born SGA among women who had a facility-based delivery. Results 1089 pregnant women delivered at the hospital and were included in this analysis. Median gestational age at delivery was 38 weeks (IQR 36-40). In multivariable analyses, risk factors for preterm birth included maternal age <20 years (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.72) and >34 years (AOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11) and severe hunger in the household (AOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.26). Risk factors for SGA were age >34 years (AOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.59), twin pregnancy (AOR 3.28, 95% CI 1.20 to 8.95) and first pregnancy (AOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.23). Number of prior abortions was associated with reduced risk for SGA (AOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.97). Conclusions Food insecurity as a risk factor for preterm birth stands out as an important addition to the understanding of the risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality. This association highlights a potentially important intervention target to improve birth outcomes and suggests that food support has an important role to play for pregnant women who are food insecure in low-income settings.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

We examine the food security effects of plant clinics, a novel agricultural extension model that aims to reduce crop losses due to pests through the provision of demand-driven plant health diagnostic and advisory services to smallholder farmers. The study is based on survey data from maize-growing households in Rwanda, where 66 plant clinics have been established. Using switching regression and matching techniques as well as various food security metrics, including the food insecurity experience scale, we find evidence that participation in plant clinics is significantly associated with a reduction in household food insecurity. For instance, among the participating households, plant clinics contribute to a decrease in the period of food shortage by one month and a reduction in the severity of food insecurity by 22 percentage points. We also show that these effects are more pronounced for female-headed households. Overall, our findings suggest that plant clinics can play an important role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 2 of zero hunger. © 2020 The Authors.

The prevention of arbovirus transmission depends on effective measures to control vectors and promote health. The objective of this study was to examine the factors that enhance and impair the endemic disease control agents’ field work, based on their own perspective. Methodology and main findings In 2017, 65 ACE of seven municipalities participated in a series of seven focus groups in the Zona de Mata mesoregion (Minas Gerais, Brazil). The focus groups were organized aiming to broaden and deepen the discussion and analysis of ACE perception of their performance in relation to attributions, work processes, training, continuous education, and evaluation. All the workers, irrespective of municipality, recognize their role in disease prevention and health promotion, however they suffer from a reductionist stigma associated with their profession. Also, internal and external factors such as infrastructure, resources, administrative management, and the work process affect the quality of service delivered and job satisfaction. Practice challenges include incompatible demands such as refusal by residents and high sense of insecurity related to violence. The respondents reported that success of their activities depend on the population. Conclusions/Significance The recurrence of epidemics demands effective vector control policies. Therefore, the performance of these professionals as regards surveillance needs to be reassessed. Public awareness and acknowledgement of the role of ACE in the identification of risk and health protection factors are indispensable for the improvement of this workforce. © 2019 Donateli et al.

The current conclusions are qualified by limited longitudinal research testing sophisticated process-oriented explanatory models for child adjustment outcomes. In this study, consistent with a developmental psychopathology perspective emphasizing the value of process-oriented longitudinal study of child adjustment in developmental and social-ecological contexts, we tested emotional insecurity about the community as a dynamic, within-person mediating process for relations between sectarian community violence and child adjustment. Specifically, this study explored children's emotional insecurity at a person-oriented level of analysis assessed over 5 consecutive years, with child gender examined as a moderator of indirect effects between sectarian community violence and child adjustment. In the context of a five-wave longitudinal research design, participants included 928 mother-child dyads in Belfast (453 boys, 475 girls) drawn from socially deprived, ethnically homogenous areas that had experienced political violence. Youth ranged in age from 10 to 20 years and were 13.24 (SD = 1.83) years old on average at the initial time point. Greater insecurity about the community measured over multiple time points mediated relations between sectarian community violence and youth's total adjustment problems. The pathway from sectarian community violence to emotional insecurity about the community was moderated by child gender, with relations to emotional insecurity about the community stronger for girls than for boys. The results suggest that ameliorating children's insecurity about community in contexts of political violence is an important goal toward improving adolescents' well-being and adjustment. These results are discussed in terms of their translational research implications, consistent with a developmental psychopathology model for the interface between basic and intervention research.

Few studies have assessed the relationships between differing dietary patterns and risk for type 2 diabetes in Indigenous communities in Canada. The objective of the study was to characterize dietary patterns using factor analysis (FA) and to relate these patterns to the incidence of type 2 diabetes after 10 years of follow up in a First Nations community in Ontario, Canada. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of 492 participants in the SLHDP who did not have diabetes at baseline (1993 to 1995) and were followed for 10 years. A food-frequency questionnaire was administered, and FA was used to identify patterns of food consumption. Multivariate logistic regression analyses determined associations of food patterns with incident type 2 diabetes, adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders. Results At follow up, 86 participants had developed incident type 2 diabetes. FA revealed 3 prominent dietary patterns: Balanced Market Foods, Beef and Processed Foods and Traditional Foods. After adjustment for age, sex, waist circumference, interleukin-6 and adiponectin, the Beef and Processed Foods pattern was associated with increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes (OR=1.38; 95% CI 1.02, 1.86). In contrast, the Balanced Market Foods and Traditional Foods Patterns were not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. Conclusions Dietary interventions should encourage reduced consumption of unhealthful market foods, in combination with improvements in local food environments so as to increase access to healthful foods and reduce food insecurity in Indigenous communities. © 2016 Canadian Diabetes Association","First Nations; food patterns; indigenous; nutrition; type 2 diabetes mellitus","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Canada; Child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Incidence; Indians, North American; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Risk Factors; adiponectin; interleukin 6; glucose blood level; Article; beef; body mass; canned food; controlled study; dietary intake; disease association; factor analysis; human; incidence; major clinical study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; processed meat; prospective study; waist circumference; adolescent; adult; aged; American Indian; Canada; child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; ethnology; feeding behavior; glucose blood level; middle aged; multivariate analysis; risk factor; statistical model","A.

Yet there are few scales suitable to assess it, and no scales to measure perceived job precariousness in working students who are particularly vulnerable. Using classic test theory, we generated 21 job precariousness items and had them reviewed by experts. In Study 1 (N = 282, 63% female, mean age 22 years), exploratory factor analysis yielded four factors of job conditions, security, remuneration, and flexibility, each with 3 items. In Study 2 (N = 211, 75% female, mean age 22 years), confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that this four-factor model was the best fit compared to unidimensional, second-order, and bifactor models. Cronbach’s α coefficients for all factors and the full-scale score were sound (all >.78). Validity was supported by showing that precariousness was related negatively to life satisfaction and employer support and positively to job insecurity, financial strain, and subjective social status. Precariousness was unrelated to age, sex, and hours worked. The Job Precariousness Scale has the potential to promote research into the effects of precarious employment on working students’ current and future functioning and achievement and how experiences of precariousness influence the development of a precarity identity. © The Author(s) 2020.","precarious employment; precarity identity; scale development; work and study; working students","","P.A.

We developed a diabetes self-management education program contextualized to the study population, including dietary preferences, health literacy, and health system. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a self-management + text message program (¡Sí, Yo Puedo Vivir Sano con Diabetes!) on primary (HbA1c), and secondary behavioral (self-management), clinical, and psychosocial outcomes in adults with T2D in Mexico City. Methods: Participants were recruited at public primary healthcare centers (Seguro Popular), and randomly allocated to treatment (n = 26) or wait-list control groups (n = 21) with data collected at 3 and 6 mo. The program included 7 weekly sessions and 6 mo of daily text/picture messages. Descriptive statistics and a generalized linear mixed model with intent-to-treat analysis were calculated. Results: Participants were 55.5 ± 8.8 y of age (mean ± SD), 68% female, 88.6% overweight/obese, and 57% lived in food-insecure households. Mean ± SD T2D duration was 11.9 ± 7.8 y and HbA1c was 9.2% ± 1.5%. There was 89% attendance at sessions and 6.4% attrition across both groups at 6 mo. Group-by-time effects were seen in self-monitoring of blood glucose (P < 0.01) and diabetes self-efficacy (P < 0.04); and a trend for lower HbA1c was seen in the intervention group at 6 mo (P = 0.11). Significant improvements in dietary behavior (P < 0.01) were demonstrated in the intervention group over time, but this did not reach statistical significance compared with the control group. Conclusions: The program was associated with clinically significant improvements in T2D self-management, self-efficacy, and HbA1c over time. Thus, T2D self-management skills, including diet, were improved in a vulnerable metropolitan population. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03159299.

As the objective in SDGs of ""halving the proportion of hungry people by 2015"" has not been achieved as scheduled, it will become more challenging to realize its final goal of zero hunger by 2030. So exploring the underlying causes of global food security pattern from perspectives of spatio-temporal evolution is badly needed. In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation method with multi-indices was applied to evaluate the food security level of 172 countries in 2000-2014 based on an established global database with country-specific time series data. Then the spatial pattern and changing characteristics of global food security by country was conducted through the spatial autocorrelation analysis. Upon this basis, the underlying factors affecting the food security pattern were further identified and analyzed with a multiple nonlinear regression method. The findings and results show that: (1) The global food security pattern can be summarized as ""high-high and low-low agglomerations"" of socio-economic status and food security level. The most food secure countries are mainly distributed in the regions with more advanced economy such as North America, Oceania, parts of East Asia, and Western Europe. On the contrary, the least food secure countries are mainly distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, West Asia, and parts of Southeast Asia. (2) At 99% confidence level, Western Europe and sub-Saharan Africa are respectively the hot and cold spots in global food security landscape, while in non-aggregation areas such as Haiti and North Korea, there exist long-term food insecurity problems. (3) The spatio-temporal pattern of global food security is generally stable, but the internal changes in the extremely insecure groups are significant. The countries with the most changeable levels of food security are also the countries with the most food insecurity. (4) Annual mean temperature, per capita GDP, the proportion of people who have access to clean water, and political stability are the key factors affecting the global food security pattern. The study indicates that while the global food security situation has improved since 2000, there was a reverse sign or omen in 2013. Affected by climate change, residents' purchasing power, infrastructure condition, and political and economic stability, global food security has in fact been volatile and some areas in the world are still facing acute food security problems. In addressing this challenge, a food security strategy based on the four dimensions, i. e. food supply, food access, food use and political stability, and a worldwide rural revitalization approach, is highly recommended. Meanwhile, it is necessary to progressively introduce some diversified modes of production such as urban agriculture to build a more resilient food system in those fully urbanized regions. © 2020, Science Press.

The majority of land available for agriculture is already used for food production, but despite the productivity gains, one in nine people worldwide are classified as food insecure. There is an increasing risk that addressing food insecurity through methods such as agricultural expansion or intensification could lead to biodiversity loss through destruction of habitats important for conservation. This analysis uses various indicators of biodiversity at a global scale, including biodiversity hotspots, total species richness, and threatened and endemic species richness. Areas where high biodiversity coexists with high food insecurity or a high risk of agricultural expansion, were examined and found to mainly occur in the tropics, with Madagascar standing out in particular. The areas identified are especially at risk of biodiversity loss, and so are global priorities for further research and for policy development to address food insecurity and biodiversity loss together. © 2017 by the authors.","Biodiversity conservation; Food security; Land use","","A.

Globally, it is estimated that 10–20% of drylands are already degraded and about 12 million ha are degraded each year. Driven by unsustainable land use practices, adverse climatic conditions and population increase, land degradation has led to decline in provision of ecosystem services, food insecurity, social and political instability and reduction in the ecosystem’s resilience to natural climate variability. Several global initiatives have been launched to combat land degradation, including rehabilitation of degraded drylands. This review aimed at collating the current state-of-knowledge about rehabilitation of degraded drylands. It was found that the prospect of restoring degraded drylands is technically promising using a suite of passive (e.g. area exclosure, assisted natural regeneration, rotational grazing) and active (e.g. mixed-species planting, framework species, maximum diversity, and use of nurse tree) rehabilitation measures. Advances in soil reclamation using biological, chemical and physical measures have been made. Despite technical advances, the scale of rehabilitation intervention is small and lacks holistic approach. Development of processbased models that forecast outcomes of the various rehabilitation activities will be useful tools for researchers and practitioners. The concept of forest landscape restoration approach, which operates at landscape-level, could also be adopted as the overarching framework for rehabilitation of degraded dryland ecosystems. The review identified a data gap in cost-benefit analysis of rehabilitation interventions. However, the cost of rehabilitation and sustainable management of drylands is opined to be lower than the losses that accrue from inaction, depending on the degree of degradation. Thus, local communities’ participation, incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge, clear division of tasks and benefits, strengthening local institutions are crucial not only for cost-sharing, but also for the long-term success of rehabilitation activities. © 2017, Finnish Society of Forest Science.

It takes advantage of Global Findex database and Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) – both included in the 2014-round of Gallup World Poll that collects data at individual-level and comparable worldwide. Our outcome variable of interest is the individual’s probability of experiencing food insecurity related to difficulties in access to food, measured through FIES. Econometrically, we employ different non-experimental impact evaluation methods: entropy balancing, propensity scores matching and fully interacting linear matching in order to ensure the consistency of our results. We find mixed food security effects depending on the type of service used. Use of savings accounts significantly decreases, use of credit significantly increases and use of formal payment services has no effect on the individual’s probability of experiencing food insecurity. This is consistent with the view that the specific features, rather than the range, of services offered by formal financial sector are the key determinants of their impact on household welfare, thus emphasizing the need to capture more contextual variables in future impact studies to understand not only the size of the impact but how this impact is shaped. © 2020, AfricaGrowth Institute.

Ltd., Ibadan, 200272, Nigeria","In Nigeria, the recurring impoverishment and other negative socioeconomic impacts endured by landholders affected by expropriation are well-documented and call into question the Land Use Act's (LUA) effectiveness in protecting local land rights. The World Bank's Land Governance Assessment Framework found that, in Nigeria, ""a large number of acquisitions occurs without prompt and adequate compensation, thus leaving those losing land worse off, with no mechanism for independent appeal even though the land is often not utilized for a public purpose"". Such negative outcomes may be due to a number of factors, including corruption, limited capacity, and insufficient financing as well as Nigeria's weak legal framework. According to a recent study of compensation procedures established in national laws of 50 countries, Nigeria's compensation procedure lags behind many of the countries assessed because the LUA mostly fails to adopt international standards on the valuation of compensation. This article examines Nigerian expropriation and compensation procedures in more detail by combining both an in-depth legal analysis of Nigeria's expropriation laws as well as survey and qualitative research that indicates, to some extent, how expropriation laws function in practice in Nigeria. Based on our legal assessment, surveys, and interviews with both government and private sector officials involved in the LFTZ, we found that the Nigerian government failed to comply with international standards on expropriation and compensation, both in terms of its laws and its practices in the LFTZ case. This article expands our conference paper written for the UN Economic Commission of Africa Conference on Land Policy in Africa, which took place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in November of 2017. Under Nigeria's LUA, affected landholders are not granted the right to participate in expropriation and compensation decision-making or otherwise be consulted on matters affecting their land and livelihoods. In 2004, the LUA enabled the Lagos State government to set aside 16,500 hectares of expropriated agricultural land from Lagos coastal communities to develop the Lekki Free Trade Zone (LFTZ). Following the expropriation, the Lagos State Government (LSG) and Lekki Worldwide Investment Limited signed a Memorandum of Understand (MOU) with nine affected communities in 2007. The MOU is a legally binding document that promises compensation, alternative land, jobs, healthcare, and educational opportunities to the communities affected by expropriation. However, our research suggests that the MOU has not been fully honored. According to a survey of 140 affected households conducted in August 2017, the government still had not paid sufficient compensation to all affected communities or had not yet provided them with suitable alternative land, jobs, equity shares and other entitlements promised by the MOU. While there are several reasons why the MOU has not been honored, this article mainly focuses on the failure of the LUA to establish binding obligations on government officials to compensation, resettle, and reconstruct the livelihoods of affected landholders. This article argues that the LUA must be reformed so that, whenever land is expropriated for development projects, the government and private sector entities (i.e., acquiring bodies) have a legal obligation to provide sufficient and prompt compensation, alternative land, jobs, equity shares, and other entitlements to affected landholders. Moreover, the LUA should obligate the government and acquiring bodies to follow a transparent and participatory process when expropriating land and compensating communities so that, if properly enforced, the reformed LUA can mitigate the risks commonly associated with expropriation, including landholder impoverishment, displacement, food insecurity, and conflict. © 2018 by the authors.","Compensation; Compulsory acquisition; Expropriation; Indigenous land rights; Land investment; Land tenure; Land valuation","","N.K.

The data are drawn from a survey of 720 married people ages 15 to 29 conducted in the city of Tehran in 2014. The results show that almost half of respondents approved of divorce as a solution for marital problems and one fifth of them have high propensity to divorce. Multivariate analyses indicate that approval of and high propensity toward divorce are significantly associated with ideational factors—namely individualism, secularism, and gender egalitarian views—and structural factors—including education, wife’s employment, and household economic insecurity—even after controlling for demographic variables. We discuss the implications of these findings for the understanding of marital stability in this rapidly changing context. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Divorce; gender egalitarian; individualism; modernization; secularism","","R.

While the risk of heavy metal contamination associated to wild food consumption has been extensively studied in the Arctic, data are scarce for the Boreal zone. This study addressed the concerns over possible heavy metal exposure through consumption of traditional food in four Anishnaabeg communities living in the Eastern North American boreal forest. Liver and meat samples were obtained from 196 snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) trapped during winter 2012 across the traditional lands of the participating communities and within 56-156 km of a copper smelter. Interviews were conducted with 78 household heads to assess traditional food habits, focusing on snowshoe hare consumption. Concentrations in most meat and liver samples were below the detection limit for As, Co, Cr, Ni and Pb. Very few meat samples had detectable Cd and Hg concentrations, but liver samples had mean dry weight concentrations of 3.79 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg respectively. Distance and orientation from the smelter did not explain the variability between samples, but percent deciduous and mixed forest cover had a marginal negative effect on liver Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations. The estimated exposition risk from snowshoe hare consumption was low, although heavy consumers could slightly exceed recommended Hg doses. In accordance with the holistic perspective commonly adopted by indigenous people, the nutritional and sociocultural importance of traditional food must be considered in risk assessment. Traditional food plays a significant role in reducing and preventing serious health issues disproportionately affecting First Nations, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Aboriginal people; Environmental contamination; Heavy metals; Lepus americanus; Snowshoe hare; Traditional food","Animals; Culture; Food Safety; Food Supply; Hares; Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points; Liver; Meat; Metals, Heavy; Nutritive Value; Quebec; Risk Assessment; North America; Lepus americanus; Food microbiology; Food supply; Forestry; Heavy metals; Lead; Meats; Nutrition; Pollution; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Smelting; arsenic; chromium; copper; heavy metal; lead; nickel; zinc; heavy metal; Aboriginal peoples; Environmental contamination; Lepus americanus; Snowshoe hare; Traditional food; bioaccumulation; boreal forest; food consumption; food safety; food security; health risk; health status; heavy metal; indigenous population; pollution exposure; animal experiment; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cultural anthropology; disease severity; dry weight; environmental exposure; food; food contamination; food insecurity; food intake; food safety; hare; Lepus americanus; limit of detection; nonhuman; nutritional health; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; seasonal variation; social class; traditional food; winter; animal; catering service; chemistry; food safety; hare; hazard assessment; liver; meat; nutritional value; Quebec; Chemical contamination","H.

The iron deficiency anemia is a worldwide public problem, especially in developing countries, related to increased body needs and inadequate supply of iron from the diet. Objective. To analyze the association of food insecurity with hemoglobin concentration and the prevalence of anemia in preschool aged children in the city of Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 306 children of preschool age. The nutritional status was assessed according to hemoglobin level and anthropometric indicators. Socioeconomic data and Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale (EBIA) results were obtained from interview with parents. Results. The prevalence of anemia was around 19% of preschool aged children and 41.2% families presented food insecurity. The anthropometric indicators were not associated with food insecurity and even though the bivariate analysis demonstrated that mild food insecurity affects the hemoglobin level, after adjusting the multivariate model this association lost significance (p>0.05). Conclusion. The prevalence of anemia of 19.2% and the household food insecurity was found among 42.2% of the population. © 2018 Élida Mara Braga Rocha et al.","","","É.M.B.

Measurement of water access at the level of communities and households remains crude, and better measures of household water insecurity are urgently needed to inform needs assessments and monitoring and evaluation. We set out to assess the validity of a quantitative scale of household water insecurity, and to investigate (1) whether improvements to community water supply reduce water insecurity, (2) whether water interventions affect women's psychological distress, and (3) the impacts of water insecurity on psychological distress, independent of socio-economic status, food security, and harvest quality. Methods and Findings: Measures were taken before and one to six months after a community water supply improvement in three villages in rural northern Ethiopia. Villages similar in size and access to water sources and other amenities did not receive interventions, and served as controls. Household water insecurity was assessed using a 21-item scale based on prior qualitative work in Ethiopia. Women's psychological distress was assessed using the WHO Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Respondents were either female heads of household or wives of the heads of household (n = 247 at baseline, n = 223 at endline); 123 households provided data at both rounds. The intervention was associated with a decline of approximately 2 points on the water insecurity scale between baseline and endline compared to the control (beta -1.99; 95% CI's -3.15, -0.84). We did not find evidence of impact of the intervention on women's psychological distress. Water insecurity was, however, predictive of psychological distress (p <0.01), independent of household food security and the quality of the previous year's harvest. Conclusion: These results contribute to the construct validity of our water insecurity scale, and establish our approach to measuring water insecurity as a plausible means of evaluating water interventions. Improvements to community water supplies were effective in reducing household water insecurity, but not psychological distress, in this population. Water insecurity was an important predictor of psychological distress. This study contributes to an emerging literature on quantitative assessment of household water insecurity, and draws attention to the potential impact of improved access to water on women's mental well-being. © 2016 Stevenson et al.

Statistical or process-based crop models can be used to quantify how yields will respond to these events and future climate change. However, the accuracy of weather-yield relationships derived from crop models, whether statistical or process-based, is dependent on the quality of the underlying input data used to run these models. In this context, a major challenge in many developing countries is the lack of accessible and reliable meteorological datasets. Gridded weather datasets, derived from combinations of in situ gauges, remote sensing, and climate models, provide a solution to fill this gap, and have been widely used to evaluate climate impacts on agriculture in data-scarce regions worldwide. However, these reference datasets are also known to contain important biases and uncertainties. To date, there has been little research to assess how the choice of reference datasets influences projected sensitivity of crop yields to weather. We compare multiple freely available gridded datasets that provide daily weather data over the Indian sub-continent over the period 1983-2005, and explore their implications for estimates of yield responses to weather variability for key crops grown in the region (wheat and rice). Our results show that individual gridded weather datasets vary in their representation of historic spatial and temporal temperature and precipitation patterns across India. We show that these differences create large uncertainties in estimated crop yield responses and exposure to variability in growing season weather, which in turn, highlights the need for improved consideration of input data uncertainty in statistical studies that explore impacts of climate variability and change on agriculture. © 2019 The Author(s).

Female Yazidi refugees from Northern Iraq who survived attacks of the so-called “Islamic State” were brought to Germany to receive special medical and psychotherapeutic treatment in a unique worldwide humanitarian admission program (HAP). Here, we report on their psychosomatic symptoms and helpful strategies from the perspective of care providers. Methods Care providers (N = 84) in this HAP were interviewed in an individual setting as well as in focus groups to gather information about the HAP beneficiaries’ psychosomatic symptoms. Data analysis followed Qualitative Content Analysis by Mayring. Results The care providers reported five main psychological burdens of the Yazidis: 1) insecurity regarding loss, 2) worries about family members, 3) ambivalence about staying in Germany or returning to Iraq, 4) life between two worlds and 5) re-actualization of the traumatic experiences. The predominant psychological symptoms the care providers noticed were fear, depressive symptoms, feelings of guilt, and sleep and eating disorders. Regarding somatic symptoms, the care providers mainly received complaints about pain in the head, back, chest and stomach. Helpful strategies for providing adequate health care were care providers’ cooperating with physicians, precise documentation of beneficiaries’ symptoms, and additional support in directing the beneficiaries through the health care system. Regarding psychotherapy, interpreters help to overcome language barriers, onsite psychotherapy, flexible therapy appointments, psychoeducational methods, time for stabilization, and support in coping with daily life aspects. In the care providers’ experience, psychotherapists have to build a relationship of trust. After grief therapy, a trauma-specific therapy in a culturally adapted way is possible. Conclusion The HAP is a unique model health care program to offer highly traumatized refugees medical and psychological help. Care providers reported on several (psycho-)somatic symptoms of the traumatized women. The strategies the HAP care providers perceived as helpful can be recommended for similar projects in the future. Copyright: © 2020 Rometsch et al.

It has deleterious effects in SC, including lower school achievement due to impaired cognitive development and physical growth, fatigue and poor attention span, and increased morbidity because of reduced resistance to infection. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anemia among SC attending public primary schools in Gondar town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods A school-based cross sectional study was conducted on a total of 523 SC aged from 6–14 years old. Multi-stage sampling followed by systematic random sampling techniques were employed to select study participants. Data on socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics, and dietary status of children were collected using pre-tested structured questionnaire through face-to-face interview of children’s caregivers. Anthropometric measurements were taken. Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was determined by using HemoCue 301+analyser. Stool and blood samples were collected in the school premises, and examined for intestinal and hemoparasites, respectively. Data were entered into Epi Info version 3.5.3 and transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models were fitted to identify associated factors of anemia. P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result Of the total SC participated in the study, 269 (51.4%) were males. The median (inter quartile range (IQR)) age was 12 (10–13) years, and 332 (63.5%) of them were in the age group 11–14 years. About 81 (15.5%; 95%CI: 12.4%, 18.7%) of them were anemic: 56 (69.1%) and 25 (38.9%) of them were mildly and moderately anemic, respectively. Low maternal education (AOR = 2.30; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.78), stunting (AOR = 2.22; 95%CI: 1.30, 3.80), severe food insecurity (AOR = 5.11; 95%CI: 1.53, 17.13), and soil-transmitted helminthic (STH) infection (AOR = 7.13; 95%CI: 3.16, 16.86) were found significantly associated with anemia. Conclusion Anemia among SC was found to be a mild public health problem. It was strongly associated with low maternal education, food insecurity, stunting and intestinal helminthic infection. Focused policies and strategies towards the above factors should be designed to reduce anemia among SC. © 2017 Getaneh et al.

Two-thirds of current diabetics are living in urban centers and the urban concentration of individuals with diabetes is on the rise. The problem is that in the absence of widespread clinical testing, there is no reliable way to predict which segments of the population are the most vulnerable to the onset of diabetes. Knowing who the most vulnerable are, and where they live, can guide the efficient allocation of prevention resources. Toward this end, we introduce the concept of composite vulnerability, which includes both group and individual-level attributes, and we provide a demonstration of its application to a large urban setting. The components of composite vulnerability are estimated using a novel, population-based, procedure that relies on sample survey data and nonparametric statistical techniques. First, cluster analysis identified three multivariate profiles of adult residents with type 2 diabetes, based on 35 socioeconomic indicators. Second, the undiagnosed population was screened for vulnerability based on their resemblance or fit to these multivariate profiles. Geographic neighborhoods with high concentrations of “vulnerables” could then be identified. In parallel, recursive partitioning found the best predictors of type 2 diabetes in this urban population, combined them with indicators of disadvantage, and applied them to residents in the selected neighborhoods to establish relative levels of composite vulnerability. Neighborhoods with high concentrations of residents manifesting composite vulnerability can be easily identified for targeting community-based prevention measures. © 2018 by the authors.

Box 339, Bloemfontein, 9300, South Africa","In 1989, governments worldwide promised all children the same rights by adopting the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention changed the way children were viewed and treated - in other words, as human beings with a distinct set of rights instead of as passive objects of care and charity. The objective of this paper was to undertake a child-based rights analysis to arrive at a better understanding of the meaning and number of children without parental care, the major reasons for lack of, and specific risks of children without, parental care. In addition, the paper also explored the rights violations faced by children without parental care and factors associated with child rights violations in Lesotho. Data was collected using a stakeholders' focus group discussion that was split into two groups and held simultaneously. The findings reveal that although there was a consensus on the meaning of children without parental care, there were different understandings leaning towards the professional orientations of the participants. It was found that there were about 175,650 children without parental care in Lesotho, while the vast majority (more than130, 000) were HIV and AIDS orphans. Most of these children lack basic needs and the specific risks with children living without parental care are numerous and include the following: struggling with drug and alcohol abuse and committing other delinquent acts; vulnerability to sexual abuse and different types of exploitations. The findings also indicate that the rights of these children regarding participation, provision and protection as enshrined in the UNCRC 1989 are most often violated by both family and community members. Consequently, the children suffer from property grabbing, poverty, food insecurity, dropping out of school and poor academic performance. The paper ends with some policy recommendations to enhance family, community, civil society and government's role in ensuring the rights of children without parental care. © 2004 - 2015 Social Work & Society, University of Duisburg-Essen, Center for Social Work and Social Policy.","","","","","Duisburg-Essen University","16138953","","","","English","Soc.

Quality of work life is important for nurses as it affects the safety and quality of care provided for patients as well as organizational factors. The aim of this study was to describe the status of quality of work life and to explore its predictors among nurses in Iran. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 2391 nurses in 85 Iranian public hospitals, selected through the convenience sampling. Data were collected using demographic information and the quality of work life questionnaires. Results: The mean score for total quality of work life was 2.58, indicating a low level of self-reported quality of work life, with 69.3% of nurses dissatisfied with their work life. The major influencing factors were inadequate and unfair payment, lack of solving staff problems by organization and poor management support, job insecurity, high job stress, unfair promotion policies, and inadequate involvement in the decision-making. Significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for lower quality of work life were male gender, being single, older age, having lower educational levels, and working in teaching hospitals. Conclusion: The quality of nursing work life was at a low level and needs improvement interventions. The predictors identified allow for more targeted interventions. Nursing managers and policymakers should develop and implement successful strategies appropriately to improve the quality of work life. This includes the payments, organizational and managerial support, job security, fair promotion policies, and measures to reduce job stress. © 2019, The Author(s).","Iran; Nurses; Public hospitals; Quality of work life","aged; article; convenience sample; cross-sectional study; decision making; female; gender; human; human experiment; Iran; job security; job stress; male; multicenter study; nurse manager; questionnaire; teaching hospital","E.

Despite progress in vaccine development and immunization delivery systems worldwide, populations in areas of conflict (hereafter, ""conflict settings"") often have limited or no access to lifesaving vaccines, leaving them at increased risk for morbidity and mortality related to vaccine-preventable disease. Without developing and refining approaches to reach and vaccinate children and other vulnerable populations in conflict settings, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease in these settings may persist and spread across subnational and international borders. Understanding and refining current approaches to vaccinating populations in conflict and humanitarian emergency settings may save lives. Despite major setbacks, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has made substantial progress in vaccinating millions of children worldwide, including those living in communities affected by conflicts and other humanitarian emergencies. In this article, we examine key strategic and operational tactics that have led to increased polio vaccination coverage among populations living in diverse conflict settings, including Nigeria, Somalia, and Pakistan, and how these could be applied to reach and vaccinate populations in other settings across the world. © The Author 2017.

Further, climate change has disproportionately impacted subarctic and arctic regions worldwide − surface air temperatures are now more favourable for agricultural activities − offering the potential for local food production under ambient conditions. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) intercrops grown over a two-year period in two sites (treed, windbreak-lined with native willow, Salix. spp.; and non-treed, or open) in the subarctic Indigenous community of Fort Albany First Nation, Ontario, Canada. Intercrops grown in the windbreak-lined site produced significantly greater (p < 0.05) yields and biomass than the open site. An analysis of soil chemistry (pH, P, K, Mg, NO3, NH4 and total N) showed that with some local amendments such as offal and bone meal, both the windbreak-lined and open sites can support continued agricultural use. This study informs Indigenous communities across subarctic regions of the world that climate change not only brings challenges, but also opportunities, such as potentially sustainable local food production. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; First Nations; intercrops; Subarctic; sustainable agriculture; windbreaks","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Phaseolus vulgaris; Salix; Solanum tuberosum; alternative agriculture; arctic environment; climate change; crop yield; deciduous tree; food production; food security; indigenous population; intercropping; legume; potato; subarctic region; wind break","C.D.

The first section provides the background for our analysis of global poverty and inequality. Any meaningful discussion of poverty and inequality necessarily has to be in relation to development - which, as we show, is itself contested in theory and practice (McMichael 2010). The second section provides a basic outline of a relational perspective of global development. The final section focuses on the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) initiative and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We conclude with some critical observations about the relationship between development, poverty and inequality. Global poverty and inequality in development Concerns about global poverty have been high on the agenda in world politics at least since the start of the new millennium. For example, the MDG initiative was conceived as part of the United Nations Millennium Declaration (2000), and followed by the declaration on the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (2015). This high-level focus on development and poverty is not surprising, as not only is the worldwide gap between the rich and the poor growing, but there has also been an unprecedented rise in insecurities and vulnerability in the everyday lived experiences of many people, particularly those experiencing poverty. Two highly visible issues can be drawn upon to illustrate the growth of inequality and poverty in global development. These are the growth of slum-dweller and/or squatter communities (see Cattaneo and Martinez 2014), and the rise of food insecurities for many across the globe. For example, in Planet of Slums, Mike Davis (2006) documents the rise and expansion of slum dwellings globally, and draws attention to the rapid increases in precarious living conditions in urban and peri-urban areas. The expansion of slum dwellings occurs in direct relation to development processes, including industralisation and urbanisation. In the case of food insecurities, the rise in the incidence of food riots globally since the 1980s has also been taking place in the midst of high technology-oriented, high massscale production of food for the global market (Patel 2008; Walton and Seddon 1994). Activists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), policy-makers, politicians and scholars are all engaged in rigorous debates about the scale and character of global poverty and inequality, and have embarked on various campaigns to ‘make poverty history’. © Richard Devetak, Anthony Burke, Jim George 2007.","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","978-131685518-8; 978-131663155-3","","","English","An Introduction to International Relations, Third edition","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139279493"

Besides ENSO, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are known to impact crop yields worldwide. Here we assess for the first time in a unified framework the relationships between ENSO, IOD and NAO and simulated crop productivity at the sub-country scale. Our findings reveal that during 1961-2010, crop productivity is significantly influenced by at least one large-scale climate oscillation in two-thirds of global cropland area. Besides observing new possible links, especially for NAO in Africa and the Middle East, our analyses confirm several known relationships between crop productivity and these oscillations. Our results improve the understanding of climatological crop productivity drivers, which is essential for enhancing food security in many of the most vulnerable places on the planet. © 2018 The Author(s).","","Africa; Asia; Latin America; Middle East; agricultural land; climate oscillation; crop production; crop yield; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; food security; Indian Ocean Dipole; nature-society relations; North Atlantic Oscillation; vulnerability; Africa; article; cropland; dipole; driver; El Nino; food security; harvest; human; Indian Ocean; Middle East; North Atlantic oscillation; simulation","M.

In Brazil, the configuration of a Food and Nutrition Security (FNS) policy has gained prominence in the government agenda since 1980. We highlight the creation of the National Council for Food and Nutrition Security (CON-SEA) aiming at articulation between sectors and social participation. This article examines the role of CONSEA in coordinating FNS policy in Brazil from 2006 to 2016. The research was based on the approaches of historical institutionalism and used the dynamics of action and the CONSEA agenda as axes of analysis. The methodological strategies carried out were: bibliographic review, document analysis and semi-structured interviews. It was observed that CONSEA was marked by an expressive performance by civil society and variable participation of government representatives. Regarding the agenda, conflicting topics were much debated, but had little impact on the adoption of legal and normative measures. It is concluded that the strengthening of CONSEA, combined with the confrontation of economic interests, adequate financing and the performance of the State in social protection, are essential for overcoming challenges, implementing the FNS policy and promoting the health of the population. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

In this study, we assess changes in mental health during the early months of the pandemic in Canada and examine its relationship with another prominent problem during this time, economic concerns. Methods: Analyses were based on two cycles of the nationally representative repeated cross-sectional Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (N=4627 in March and 4600 in May). We described the changes in mental health and economic concerns between March and May, and assessed the relationship between the two characteristics. Results: Mental health declined significantly during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the proportion of Canadian adults who reported only good/fair/poor mental health grew from 46% to 52% from March to May. Economic concerns including food insecurity were an important correlate of ‘bad’ mental health, as was younger age, female gender, and Canada-born status. Contrary to expectations, however, economic concerns lessened during this time frame. Conclusions: These findings suggest that policies to mitigate economic stress, such as Canada's Emergency Response Benefit, may have eased mental health deterioration in early pandemic months through a reduction in financial hardship. Interventions to increase the economic security of the population will have far-reaching consequences in terms of improved mental health, and should be continued throughout the pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s)","Adults; Anxiety; Canada; COVID-19; Economic concerns; Mental health","adult; age; Article; Canada; clinical assessment; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; economics; female; food insecurity; gender; health care policy; health status; human; mental health; pandemic; priority journal; social status; wellbeing","A.

Unexpected flooding increases risk of diarrheal diseases and is expected to occur with increased frequency in the 21st century. Water insecurity is linked to mental distress in water scarce regions, yet this construct has not been examined closely among populations living in flood-prone regions. This paper examines how differences in water sources and lifestyle among Tsimane’ forager-horticulturalists in lowland Bolivia are related to water insecurity after a historic flood in 2014, and in turn, how water insecurity is associated with diarrhea and dehydration. Pre-flood data come from qualitative interviews with 36 household heads, anthropometrics, participant observation, and water quality analysis between September 2013–January 2014 used to create a locally-adapted water insecurity questionnaire. Water insecurity was measured after the historic flood; no pre-flood water insecurity measures are available. Post-flood data were collected through surveys, water quality analysis, and health exams using near-exhaustive sampling in two villages, yielding 118 adults and 115 children (aged 2–12 years) in 62 households between March–April 2014. Overall, 89% of adults reported medium or high water insecurity. Only hand-pumps tested negative for pathogenic bacteria both pre- and post-flood. Tobit regressions suggest that hand-pumps (when available) and adult age were associated with lower water insecurity scores. Multiple logistic regressions suggest that adults with high water insecurity were more likely to report diarrhea than adults with low (Odds Ratio [OR] 9.2; 95% CI: 1.27–67.1). Children from households with medium (OR: 6.8; 95% CI: 1.41–32.5) or high (OR: 14.0; 95% CI: 2.40–81.5) water insecurity had significantly higher odds of dehydration than children in households with low water insecurity. Catastrophic flooding may systematically increase dimensions of household water insecurity. This research suggests an experience-based measure of water insecurity is associated with objective health outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bolivia; Dehydration; Diarrheal diseases; Flooding; Water insecurity; Water quality","Adult; Bolivia; Child; Child, Preschool; Dehydration; Diarrhea; Disasters; Family Characteristics; Female; Floods; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Water Supply; Amazonia; Bolivia; dehydration; diarrheal disease; flooding; historical perspective; resource scarcity; water quality; adult; anthropometry; Article; bacterium; Bolivia; child; controlled study; dehydration; diarrhea; disaster; female; flooding; forager; health hazard; household; human; interview; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; population research; preschool child; public health; qualitative research; quality control; questionnaire; sampling; school child; scoring system; water availability; water contamination; water quality; water supply; dehydration; diarrhea; disaster; family size; middle aged","A.Y.

Cochliobolus species major epidemics such as the Great Bengal famine, Southern corn leaf blight, and Northern leaf spot blight were associated with substantial economic losses in the past decades. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish a specific coordinated global surveillance program for the migration of invasive Cochliobolus species, planning contextual control programs engaging all agricultural stakeholders and information sharing in real time for prevention of disastrous Cochliobolus disease outbreak effects. We discuss pertinent outcome of interactions of cash crops with Cochliobolus species having devastating impact on the livelihood of farmers and food security. While post-genomic era elucidated prominent differences among Cochliobolus heterostrophus, C. carbonum, C. victoriae, C. lunatus and C. miyabeanus, their destructive potentials and implications in food losses remained unearthed. Intriguingly, the annual colossal losses caused by Cochliobolus species in the production perspective of sorghum, wheat, rice, maize, cassava and soybean is estimated over 10 billion USD worldwide.

In Europe, about one-Third of all refugees are children, an increasing number of which are travelling alone. There are often no systematic medical health assessments for these refugee children on entry in reception countries despite the fact that they are recognised as an at-risk population due to increased burden of physical and mental health conditions. We aimed to perform a systematic review of the literature to describe the health status of refugee children on entering reception countries. Methods A systematic search of published literature was conducted using the terms refugee, immigrant or migrant, medical or health, and screening. Results Of the 3487 potentially relevant papers, 53 population-based studies were included in this review. This systematic review showed that refugee children exhibit high estimated prevalence rates for anaemia (14%), haemoglobinopathies (4%), chronic hepatitis B (3%), latent tuberculosis infection (11%) and vitamin D deficiency (45%) on entry in reception countries. Approximately one-Third of refugee children had intestinal infection. Nutritional problems ranged from wasting and stunting to obesity. Conclusions Refugee children entering reception countries should receive comprehensive health assessments based on the outcomes of this systematic review, national budgets, cost-effectiveness and personal factors of the refugees. The health assessment should be tailored to individual child health needs depending on preflight, flight and postarrival conditions. A paradigm shift that places focus on child health and development will help this vulnerable group of children integrate into their new environments.

While the implications of the concomitant economic downturn for older adults are just beginning to be recognized, past experience suggests that the consequences could be devastating for many. Analyses indicate that more than one out of five Americans aged 65 years or older live in counties where high infection rates and high economic insecurity risks occur simultaneously. These findings highlight the overlap between current infection patterns and subsequent challenges to economic security that are impacting older people. Strategies and supports for getting people back to work must take into account the large segment of older people who rely on earnings well into later life. Social Security serves as the foundation of economic security for older adults across the income continuum, but it is frequently insufficient in and of itself, let alone during a crisis. Recognizing the importance of cost of living in shaping economic security highlights the need for the federal and state governments and municipalities to take older people into account in the economic recovery effort. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","cost of living; COVID-19; economic downturn; economic security; Elder Index","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Economic Recession; Humans; Income; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Security; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; United States; adult; business cycle; COVID-19; economic impact; elderly population; epidemic; living standard; social security; viral disease; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; economic recession; economics; human; income; pandemic; social security; socioeconomics; United States; very elderly; virus pneumonia","Y.

In response, most countries in the world implemented lockdowns, restricting their population's movements, work, education, gatherings, and general activities in attempt to “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 cases. The public health goal of lockdowns was to save the population from COVID-19 cases and deaths, and to prevent overwhelming health care systems with COVID-19 patients. In this narrative review I explain why I changed my mind about supporting lockdowns. The initial modeling predictions induced fear and crowd-effects (i.e., groupthink). Over time, important information emerged relevant to the modeling, including the lower infection fatality rate (median 0.23%), clarification of high-risk groups (specifically, those 70 years of age and older), lower herd immunity thresholds (likely 20–40% population immunity), and the difficult exit strategies. In addition, information emerged on significant collateral damage due to the response to the pandemic, adversely affecting many millions of people with poverty, food insecurity, loneliness, unemployment, school closures, and interrupted healthcare. Raw numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths were difficult to interpret, and may be tempered by information placing the number of COVID-19 deaths in proper context and perspective relative to background rates. Considering this information, a cost-benefit analysis of the response to COVID-19 finds that lockdowns are far more harmful to public health (at least 5–10 times so in terms of wellbeing years) than COVID-19 can be. Controversies and objections about the main points made are considered and addressed. Progress in the response to COVID-19 depends on considering the trade-offs discussed here that determine the wellbeing of populations. I close with some suggestions for moving forward, including focused protection of those truly at high risk, opening of schools, and building back better with a economy. © Copyright © 2021 Joffe.","cost-benefit analysis; COVID-19; groupthink; lockdowns; public health","Age Factors; Aging; Communicable Disease Control; Cost-Benefit Analysis; COVID-19; Humans; Poverty; Public Health; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Unemployment; age; aging; communicable disease control; cost benefit analysis; human; mortality; poverty; prevention and control; public health; quarantine; unemployment","A.R.

Climate model simulations have shown severe resulting climate perturbations with declines in global mean temperature by 1.8 °C and precipitation by 8%, for at least 5 y. Here we evaluate impacts for the global food system. Six harmonized state-of-the-art crop models show that global caloric production from maize, wheat, rice, and soybean falls by 13 (±1)%, 11 (±8)%, 3 (±5)%, and 17 (±2)% over 5 y. Total single-year losses of 12 (±4)% quadruple the largest observed historical anomaly and exceed impacts caused by historic droughts and volcanic eruptions. Colder temperatures drive losses more than changes in precipitation and solar radiation, leading to strongest impacts in temperate regions poleward of 30°N, including the United States, Europe, and China for 10 to 15 y. Integrated food trade network analyses show that domestic reserves and global trade can largely buffer the production anomaly in the first year. Persistent multiyear losses, however, would constrain domestic food availability and propagate to the Global South, especially to food-insecure countries. By year 5, maize and wheat availability would decrease by 13% globally and by more than 20% in 71 countries with a cumulative population of 1.3 billion people. In view of increasing instability in South Asia, this study shows that a regional conflict using <1% of the worldwide nuclear arsenal could have adverse consequences for global food security unmatched in modern history. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Through a quasi-experimental design based on spatially disaggregated data, the analysis explores the effect of peri-urbanisation processes and large-scale land acquisitions on the risk of organised violence. The results, confirmed throughout several model specifications and robustness checks, provide evidence that peri-urbanisation processes are strongly associated with a higher risk of experiencing events of organised violence. The likelihood of being the arena of such events is even higher when large acquisitions are concluded within peri-urban areas. Urbanisation processes and large land acquisitions should therefore be framed within a comprehensive strategy grounded on inclusive urban planning and land access safeguards, in order to minimise the risk that land access insecurity may be translated into violence. © 2019 Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG","Africa; conflict events; large-scale land acquisitions; Peri-urban; spatial analysis","","S.

Early in 2020, the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread very quickly worldwide and was classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. Preliminary reports indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased unhealthy eating patterns, especially in at-risk populations and in children and adolescents (e.g., increased snack intake). The evolution of the pandemic and, consequently, the tightening of social restrictions (e.g., social distancing, isolation, mandatory lockdowns) led families to spend more time together in close quarters. Accordingly, the routine of families eating meals together increased, allowing for more opportunities to instill parental food practices. Furthermore, as a consequence of this health crisis, food insecurity may have increased, impacting parental feeding practices and family food consumption. Overall, current findings within the family context indicate potential impacts on child and adult obesity risk, indicating several modifiable points of intervention in this context. For this reason, exploring the recent data and the impact of COVID- 19 on children and adolescents’ eating behaviors is crucial to deepen our understanding of the phenomenon. Analysis of current literature findings is expected to prompt reflection on the role of the family and generate discussion and suggestions for best practices to follow in future crises. Additionally, this analysis is expected to elicit thinking on future policy guidelines. Hopefully, the discussion on prior findings will provide: i) a deepened foresight into the impact of the current pandemic on eating behaviors in children and adolescents, and ii) support to practitioners, researchers, and policymakers efforts in mitigating long-term negative consequences through educational tools aimed to promote healthy eating in the younger population, with particular emphasis on the family context. © 2022 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Premature motherhood can create a negative cycle of adverse health, economic and social outcomes for young women, their babies and families. Refugee and migrant adolescent girls might be particularly at risk due to poverty, poor education and health infrastructure, early marriage, limited access to contraception and traditional beliefs. This study aims to explore adolescents' perceptions and experiences of pregnancy in refugee and migrant communities on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Methods: In June 2016 qualitative data were collected in one refugee camp and one migrant clinic along the Thailand-Myanmar border by conducting 20 individual interviews with pregnant refugee and migrant adolescents and 4 focus group discussions with husbands, adolescent boys and non-pregnant girls and antenatal clinic staff. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify codes and themes emerging from the data. Results: Study participants perceived adolescent pregnancy as a premature life event that could jeopardise their future. Important themes were premarital sex, forced marriage, lack of contraception, school dropout, fear of childbirth, financial insecurity, support structures and domestic violence. Supportive relationships with mothers, husbands and friends could turn this largely negative experience into a more positive one. The main underlying reasons for adolescent pregnancy were associated with traditional views and stigma on sexual and reproductive health issues, resulting in a knowledge gap on contraception and life skills necessary to negotiate sexual and reproductive choices, in particular for unmarried adolescents. Conclusions: Adolescents perceive pregnancy as a challenging life event that can be addressed by developing comprehensive adolescent-friendly sexual and reproductive health services and education in refugee and migrant communities on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Creating a more tolerant and less stigmatising environment in these communities and their governing bodies will help to achieve this goal. © 2018 The Author(s).","Adolescent pregnancy; Contraception; Domestic violence; Forced marriage; Migrant; Myanmar; Qualitative; Refugee; Sexual and reproductive health; Stigma","Adolescent; Adult; Contraception; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Myanmar; Perception; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Qualitative Research; Refugees; Sexual Behavior; Thailand; Transients and Migrants; Young Adult; adolescent; adolescent mother; adolescent pregnancy; adult; Article; attitude to health; attitude to pregnancy; contraception; domestic violence; family planning; family relation; fear of childbirth; female; finance; forced marriage; human; husband; male; medical staff; migrant; Myanmar; paramedical personnel; peer group; personal experience; premarital sex; qualitative research; refugee; reproductive health; school dropout; sexual health; stigma; Thailand; unplanned pregnancy; young adult; adolescent pregnancy; attitude to health; migration; perception; pregnancy; psychology; qualitative research; sexual behavior","C.

We aim to understand the social structure of uncertainty in society that affects the TCAM usage for men and women. Methods: We studied 32 countries using data from the International Social Survey Programme and the World Bank. In this study, we defined TCAM usage as visits to an alternative/traditional/folk health care practitioner during the past 12 months. We performed a correlation analysis and used a generalized linear model. Results: The prevalence of TCAM usage in terms of visits to practitioners was 26.1% globally, while usage varied across the 32 countries. Generalized linear models showed that unemployment rate was associated with the prevalence of TCAM usage in terms of visits to practitioners. Conclusions: At the social-structural level TCAM usage involving visits to practitioners was related to job insecurity. Job insecurity led to a decrease in TCAM usage regarding visits to practitioners. These findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the social-structural factors of uncertainty in society when designing health policies related to TCAM. © 2019 The Author(s).","International social survey Programme; Job insecurity; Traditional, complementary and alternative medicine; Uncertainty in society","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care; Complementary Therapies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Uncertainty; Young Adult; adult; alternative medicine; article; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; health care personnel; health care policy; human; male; prevalence; social structure; uncertainty; unemployment; World Bank; adolescent; aged; alternative medicine; ambulatory care; attitude to health; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; traditional medicine; uncertainty; very elderly; young adult","J.

To address these problems, we develop Green New Deal energy roadmaps for 143 countries. The roadmaps call for a 100% transition of all-purpose business-as-usual (BAU) energy to wind-water-solar (WWS) energy, efficiency, and storage by 2050 with at least 80% by 2030. Our studies on grid stability find that the countries, grouped into 24 regions, can match demand exactly from 2050 to 2052 with 100% WWS supply and storage. We also derive new cost metrics. Worldwide, WWS energy reduces end-use energy by 57.1%, aggregate private energy costs from $17.7 to $6.8 trillion/year (61%), and aggregate social (private plus health plus climate) costs from $76.1 to $6.8 trillion/year (91%) at a present value capital cost of ∼$73 trillion. WWS energy creates 28.6 million more long-term, full-time jobs than BAU energy and needs only ∼0.17% and ∼0.48% of land for new footprint and spacing, respectively. Thus, WWS requires less energy, costs less, and creates more jobs than does BAU. © 2019 The Authors","air pollution; climate; Green New Deal; renewable energy; social cost; solar; storage; water; wind","alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; climate change; cost analysis; energy efficiency; energy management; solar power","M.Z.

PatanjaliYoga relieves stress and fatigue which haves turned into one of the few major challenges confronting the medical fraternity in present times. Yoga let go the body from any type of muscular or chronic strain and rejuvenates the body from exhaustion, body aches, stress, aids to ease the body and mind, enhances concentration and alertness, and frees the soul. It helps one to create integrity amongst his outward self as well as his innermost self. If the practices are followed meticulously then Patanjali Yoga develops a constructive effect both in the inward and outer selves of an organism. Patanjali’s yoga practice aims to bind the individual self with the Ultimate One and one can achieve this union by regulating and discarding the ever-arising ‘vrittis’ or amendments of the mind. With Patanjali Yoga mind can be balanced through the exact kind of discipline and training. The purpose of this paper was to study the effect of Patanjali Yoga practice on mental health and moral judgment of experimental group of juvenile delinquents. Pre and post experimental design was used in this research work. Patanjali Yoga practices were used as independent variables whereas mental health and moral judgments of delinquents as dependent variables. A sample of 70 delinquents of age group (13-18 years) from Government Observation Home in Agra district was chosen with random selection method. There were two groups –experimental group (n=35) and control group (n=35). Patanjali Yoga practices were imparted to delinquents for 90 days with duration of one hour each day. For measuring the moral judgment of delinquents, moral judgment test by Juri Baruh (2004) and for measuring mental health, mental health battery by A.K. Singh and Alpana Sen Gupta(2008) were used. Mean, Standard deviation and t-test were carried out for data analysis. The findings suggest that mental health factors like emotional stability, adjustment, autonomy, security-insecurity and self-concept were found to be of average level and intelligence ranged from average to low in experimental and control group delinquents. It was also found that Patanjali Yoga plays a significant role by strengthening emotional stability, adjustment and self-concept in delinquents, however, the Patanjali yoga does not significantly affects mental health factors like autonomy, security-insecurity and intelligence in delinquents. The findings also concluded that Patanjali Yoga does not affect moral judgments of delinquents. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

In fact, many popular apps use OTPs received via SMS as the only authentication factor, entirely replacing password-based authentication schemes. Although SMS OTP authentication mechanisms provide significant convenience to end-users, they also have significant security implications. In this paper, we study these mobile apps' authentication schemes based on SMS OTPs, and, in particular, we perform a systematic study on the threats posed by “local attacks, ” a scenario in which an attacker has control over an unprivileged third-party app on the victim's device. This study was carried out using a combination of reverse engineering, formal verification, user studies, and large-scale automated analysis. Our work not only revealed vulnerabilities in third-party apps, but it also uncovered several new design and implementation flaws in core APIs implemented by the mobile operating systems themselves. For instance, we found two official Android APIs to be vulnerable by design, i.e., APIs that inevitably lead to the implementation of insecure authentication schemes, even when used according to their documentation. Moreover, we found that other APIs are prone to be used unsafely by apps' developers. Our large-scale study found 36 apps, sharing hundreds of millions of installations, that misuse these APIs, allowing a malicious local attacker to completely hijack their accounts. Such vulnerable apps include Telegram and KakaoTalk, some of the most popular messaging apps worldwide. Finally, we proposed a new and safer mechanism to perform SMS-based authentication, and we prove its safety using formal verification. © 2021 28th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, NDSS 2021.

Thus, the aim of the current study was to assess the association between food insecurity (hunger) and suicide attempts in adolescents from 44 countries. Methods: Cross-sectional, school-based data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey were analyzed. Data on past 12-month suicide attempts and past 30-day food insecurity (hunger) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression, meta-analysis, and meta-regression were conducted to assess the associations. Results: The final sample consisted of 179,771 adolescents attending school. The prevalence of moderate (rarely/sometimes hungry) and severe (most of the time/always hungry) food insecurity were 46.7% and 7.0%, respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, severe food insecurity (vs. no food insecurity, i.e., no hunger) was significantly associated with higher odds for suicide attempts in 31 of the 44 countries studied with the pooled OR (95% CI) being 1.90 (1.77–2.04) (I                             2                              = 45.2%). The associations were similar across country-income levels. However, meta-regression analysis by country showed that stronger associations were related with lower population prevalence of severe food insecurity. The pooled OR (95% CI) for moderate food insecurity (vs. no food insecurity) was 1.26 (1.21–1.32) (I                             2                              = 29.7%). Limitations: Causality cannot be established due to the cross-sectional study design. Conclusions: Food insecurity (hunger) is a global problem and is associated with suicide attempts. The identification of children suffering from food insecurity (hunger) and remedying this condition may be important to improve mental health among adolescents worldwide.                          © 2019","Adolescents; Food insecurity; Hunger; Suicide attempts","Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Supply; Health Surveys; Humans; Hunger; Income; Logistic Models; Male; Poverty; Prevalence; Schools; Students; Suicide, Attempted; adolescent; adult; Article; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; food insecurity; high income country; human; hunger; low income country; major clinical study; middle income country; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; school child; suicide attempt; young adult; catering service; female; health survey; hunger; income; male; poverty; psychology; school; statistical model; student","A.

Despite the popularity of this policy uptake, there is relatively little known about the specific local factors prospectively motivating and informing development of this sector. Objective: To identify common social, economic, and health system factors shaping the development of medical tourism in three Central American and Caribbean countries and their health equity implications. Design: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Mexico, Guatemala, and Barbados with 150 health system stakeholders. Participants were recruited from private and public sectors working in various fields: trade and economic development, health services delivery, training and administration, and civil society. Transcribed interviews were coded using qualitative data management software, and thematic analysis was used to identify cross-cutting issues regarding the drivers and inhibitors of medical tourism development. Results: Four common drivers of medical tourism development were identified: 1) unused capacity in existing private hospitals, 2) international portability of health insurance, vis-a-vis international hospital accreditation, 3) internationally trained physicians as both marketable assets and industry entrepreneurs, and 4) promotion of medical tourism by public export development corporations. Three common inhibitors for the development of the sector were also identified: 1) the high expense of market entry, 2) poor sector-wide planning, and 3) structural socio-economic issues such as insecurity or relatively high business costs and financial risks. Conclusion: There are shared factors shaping the development of medical tourism in Central America and the Caribbean that help explain why it is being pursued by many hospitals and governments in the region. Development of the sector is primarily being driven by public investment promotion agencies and the private health sector seeking economic benefits with limited consideration and planning for the health equity concerns medical tourism raises. © 2016, © 2016 Rory Johnston et al.","Caribbean; Central America; health services research; medical tourism; qualitative methods","accreditation; adult; article; Barbados; Caribbean; economic development; genetic transcription; government; Guatemala; health equity; health insurance; health services research; human; investment; medical tourism; Mexico; public sector; qualitative analysis; semi structured interview; software; thematic analysis","R.

Water insecurity, which is defined as having limited or uncertain availability of safe water or the ability to acquire safe water in socially acceptable ways, is typically overlooked by development organizations focusing on water availability. To address the urgent need in the literature for validated measures of water insecurity, we conducted a population-based study in rural Uganda with 327 reproductive-age women and 204 linked men from the same households. We used a novel method of photo identification so that we could accurately elicit study participants' primary household water sources, thereby enabling us to identify water sources for objective water quality testing and distance/elevation measurement. Our psychometric analyses provided strong evidence of the internal structure, reliability, and validity of a new eight-item Household Water Insecurity Access Scale (HWIAS). Important intra-household gender differences in perceptions of water insecurity were observed, with men generally perceiving household water insecurity as being less severe compared to women. In summary, the HWIAS represents a reliable and valid measure of water insecurity, particularly among women, and may be useful for informing and evaluating interventions to improve water access in resource-limited settings. © IWA Publishing 2016.","Gender; Uganda; Water insecurity","Adult; Drinking Water; Family Characteristics; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Uganda; Water Supply; Young Adult; Uganda; drinking water; gender disparity; household survey; literature review; organizational change; perception; psychology; rural area; water availability; water management; water quality; water resource; adult; Article; female; fluid intake; food insecurity; health survey; household; human; male; population; quality control procedures; rural area; sex difference; social problem; Uganda; water availability; water insecurity; water quality; water supply; family size; health survey; procedures; psychometry; reproducibility; rural population; sex difference; water supply; young adult","A.C.

The use of biofuel such as bioethanol is as an option over conventional petroleum and important for the development of sustainable and eco-friendly energy resources. However, bioethanol manufactured from various biomass resources is different in terms of its processing stages and the need for extra pre-treatments. This study aims to suggest the most feasible biomass resource for bioethanol generation by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods based on priority estimation model. Among biomass resources, the issue of selecting the most feasible resource is evaluated, using numerous criteria influencing the biomass selection which are chosen through Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with experts in the biomass research field. Out of the five selected biomass resources, sugarcane is preferable as a bioethanol feedstock with an overall priority of 31.69%, followed by palm oil residues (overall priority= 23.51%), compared to corn (overall priority= 22.59%), rice straws (overall priority= 13.53%) and sugar beet (overall priority= 8.67%). Sugarcane is claimed to be the most feasible bioethanol feedstock due to its high availability over years, high energy ratio, high cellulose and hemicellulose content. Although sugarcane takes a longer time to grow, it is easier to be planted and harvested with the help of developed machineries. However, an ideal bioethanol-producing feedstock should not be food crops. Thus, as a suggestion for future research, more factors to determine the potential and suitability of the crops should be considered.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Z.

Determinants of stunting include poverty, food insecurity, poor sanitation, and low maternal education. Stunting has both short and long-term detrimental health and developmental effects on children. In 2020, around 149 million children under five were stunted worldwide. This study examines whether parental investment moderates the association between maternal education and childhood stunting in Kenya. Methods The 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey was used to examine the variation in childhood stunting, analysed using binary logistic regression. Subgroup effect modification models were utilized to incorporate the interactions between maternal education and parental investments: Marital status, household size, number of antenatal visits and breastfeeding duration on childhood stunting. Results This analysis included 17247 children under 5 years. The results indicated that 26% of Kenyan children under five were stunted in 2014. The prevalence of stunting was greater among males (30%) than females (22%). There was an increasing adverse effect of decreasing maternal education levels on stunting as secondary education (odd ratios (OR)=1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.40-1.98), primary education (OR=2.95; 95% CI=2.51-3.46) and no education (OR=3.07; 95% CI=2.56-3.68) relative to higher education. Breastfeeding for ≥12 months was associated with a lower risk of adverse effects of primary education (OR=3.03; 95% CI=1.82-3.36), compared to breastfeeding for ≥12 months was associated with a lower risk of adverse effects of primary education (OR=3.03; 95% CI=1.82-3.36), compared to breastfeeding for <6 months (OR=4.01; 95% CI=1.11-15.50), relative to higher education. Smaller households (2-4 members) (OR=2.96; 95% CI=1.81-5.12) and 5-7 ANC visits (OR=2.22; 95% CI=1.50-3.43) diminished the adverse effects of no maternal education relative to higher education on stunting. Conclusions In Kenya, childhood stunting still is a critical public health challenge. Parents can invest more in their offspring through planning for fewer children, attending sufficient antenatal clinics, and providing adequate breastfeeding to moderate the negative effects of low socio-economics status on their children’s health. © 2021, International Society of Global Health.

The situation has been exacerbated by emerging global socio-economic trends, population increase, land degradation, climate change and an undeveloped agricultural sector among many other causes (Bationo and Egulu, Status of implementation of Abuja declaration, 2013). It is estimated that Africa's 226.4 million people are chronically hungry (FAO 2012). Food security has been threatened in African countries since the past decades due to the decrease in soil fertility, poor use of improved technology and low investment in agriculture. These had impacted negatively on crop yields, overall agricultural production and development of African countries. The situation has been a concern to African leaders who converged to the Africa Fertilizer Summit of Abuja in 2006 to discuss and prescribe some solutions to remedy the issues. At this meeting, it was noted that Africa has the lowest rate of fertilizer application. The continent has a fertilizer application rate of about 8 kilograms per hectare, which is far below the global average of 50 kilograms per hectare. A 12-point resolution was therefore developed at the end of the summit that was aimed at achieving the global average of fertilizer use by 2015. The resolution, which was known as the Abuja Declaration on Fertilizer for an African Green Revolution spells out measures and actions that must be taken to accelerate the accessibility, availability and affordability of fertilizers in the region. On the production side, the average annual increase of cereal yield in Africa is about 10 kg ha-1, corresponding to extensive agriculture neglecting external inputs like improved seeds and plant nutrients (Bationo et al. 2004). Due to a high population growth rate (3%) compared to cereal grain yield ( < 1%) (Gruhn et al. 2000), cereal production per capita has decreased from 150 kg/person to 130 kg/ person over the last 35 years, whereas Asia and Latin America realized per capita food increase from 200 kg/person to 250 kg/ person during the same period. Although some effort are underway to improve agricultural productivity in West Africa through the increased use of improved inputs including fertilizers, it is important to notice that food insecurity is still threatening many African countries. Some scientists support that the increase in yields of the food crops has been largely due to land expansion rather than crop productivity improvement potential. There is ample evidence that increased use of inorganic fertilizers has been responsible for an important share of world-wide agricultural productivity growth. Efficient fertilizer use can stimulate production growth, improve food and nutrition security and reduce poverty through income growth for farmers and lower food costs for consumers. Nevertheless production increase in Africa is mainly attributed to area increase than productivity increase (Table 14.1). Fertilizer was as important as seed in the Green Revolution contributing as much as 50% of the yield growth in Asia (Wigg and Hopper 1993). Several studies have found that one-third of the cereal production worldwide is due to the use of fertilizer and related factors of production (Bumb 1995, citing FAO and Van Keulen and Breman 1990). A diagnosis analysis of fertilizer demand in West Africa showed some level of improvement since the Abuja Summit and more specifically after the food crisis of 2008. For instance, fertilizer consumption in the 15 ECOWAS countries was 1,020,000 tons with an average rate of 9 kg/ha in 2006, while it was estimated in the 8 WAEMU countries plus Chad at 1,025,000 tons with an average rate of 15 kg/ha in 2012 (Mando 2013). On 30 June-1 July 2013, the Food and Agriculture Organization in collaboration with the African Union Commission, and the Institute Lula convened a high level meeting in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. The meeting put together African and International Leaders to deliberate and endorse a radical approach to end hunger in Africa by 2025 building on renewed partnerships within the CAADP Framework. The present paper is an attempt to analyze the socio economic determinants of fertilizer use in West Africa since the declaration of Abuja. It will also point out progress made and their impact on agricultural outputs and people livelihood in West Africa. It will be based on recent studies conducted on fertilizer and agricultural outputs in Africa. Some indicators like fertilizer use rate and consumption, economic return of fertilizer use, effect of fertilizer use on natural resources and livelihood, and new trends in fertilizer use will be developed to show progress achieved since the Abuja Summit. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Determinants; Fertilizer use; Statistics and trends","Climate change; Crops; Developing countries; Economics; Food supply; Nutrition; Population statistics; Productivity; Seed; Agricultural productions; Agricultural productivity; Determinants; Fertilizer applications; Fertilizer use; Food and agriculture organizations; Population growth rates; Productivity increase; Fertilizers","A.R.

Both acute and chronic malnutrition are major problems for HIV-positive children living in resource-limited settings. Malnutrition on a background of HIV represents a separate clinical entity, with unique medical and social aetiological factors. Children with HIV have a higher daily calorie requirement than HIV-negative peers and also a higher requirement for micronutrients; furthermore, coinfection and chronic diarrhoea due to HIV enteropathy play a major role in HIV-associated malnutrition. Contributory factors include late presentation to medical services, unavailability of antiretroviral therapy, other issues surrounding healthcare provision and food insecurity in HIV-positive households. Treatment protocols for malnutrition have been greatly improved, yet there remains a discrepancy in mortality between HIV-positive and HIV-negative children. In this review, the aetiology, prevention and treatment of malnutrition in HIV-positive children are examined, with particular focus on resource-limited settings where this problem is most prevalent.","","Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Management; HIV Infections; Humans; Malnutrition; Nutritional Status; Risk Factors; HIV; Nutrition; Tropical Paediatrics; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; trace element; tuberculostatic agent; childhood disease; diarrhea; enteropathy; food insecurity; health care access; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infant feeding; infection prevention; malnutrition; medical service; meta analysis (topic); nutritional requirement; priority journal; review; severe acute malnutrition; article; artificial milk; bacteremia; breast feeding; caloric intake; child; childhood disease; childhood mortality; employment; esophagus candidiasis; gastroenteritis; gastrointestinal infection; health care; HIV education; household; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; income; infant mortality; lung tuberculosis; malabsorption; malaria; malnutrition; mixed infection; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; pneumonia; practice guideline; social stigma; stunting; vertical transmission; virus transmission; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; malnutrition; Review","A.M.

Large-scale assessments of current governance strategies have demonstrated the unsustainable use patterns and pollution of global water resources they produce (Gleick 1993; Postel et al. 1996; UNEP 2006). The challenges to developing sustainable strategies have been receiving greater attention over the past ﬁfteen years. International networks and programs on water governance have been developed, such as the Stockholm World Water Week and the World Water Forum. This mobilization at the global scale has drawn attention to the status of water resources and has helped improve knowledge in the ﬁeld. We now know that worldwide water consumption rises twice as fast as population grows, often in places that are already experiencing water stress, i.e., water use exceeds natural supply (UNESCO 2006: 116); more than a billion people worldwide lack access to potable water and twice as many do not have basic sanitation; some 4, 900 people die each day as a result of diarrhea (UNDP 2006). The ecological consequences of rising consumption have been equally severe: around the world, rivers, lakes and canals are severely polluted and the services they provide are compromised (UNEP 2006; UNESCO 2006). Two particularly inﬂuential global networks have emerged and are pro-posing solutions to solve these water-related problems. Perhaps the greatest programmatic focus is provided by the United Nation’s announcement of the International Water Decade from 2005-15 (The Decade). The Decade’s objectives stress that greater priority should be given to the waterrelated Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Speciﬁcally these goals are that by 2015 the proportion of people who are unable to reach or aﬀord safe drinking water and the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation should be halved. In parallel with The Decade has been the emergence of new ideas for water governance, termed integrated water resources management (IWRM). Oﬃcially coined by the Global Water Partnership, “IWRM aims to ensure the coordinated development and management of water, land, and related resources by maximizing economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital environmental systems” (GWP 2000). The term has been incorporated in water planning strategies and policy around the world as a laudable goal for water governance. However, operationalizing the term has proven to be much more of a challenge (Biswas 2004). Table 10.1 compares the key features of IWRM with to the characteristic approaches of traditional water management (Partzsch 2007: 68-72). Since the attention to the global nature of water resources paid by the Johannesburg Summit of 2002, water has gained an increasingly prominent place on the foreign policy agenda of many countries. However, the scope of academic inquiry in the issue area of water foreign policy is rather undeveloped and has largely consisted of explorations of environmental insecurity due to decreasing water quantity and quality and the public health impacts of these trends (Starr 1991; Lewis 2007). There are three focal areas for assessing issues related to water foreign policy: (1) quantity (where water is located and where it is distributed to in what volume); (2) quality (the degree to which water is polluted, saline, or bacteria and nutrientloaded); and (3) infrastructure (the means by which water is transported and delivered to and from users). Translating these issue areas into an eﬀective foreign policy program for water resources is a new and critically important area of water governance. Incorporating the complexity of water resources and governance into these programs and strategies is still in its infancy. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview and analysis of the water foreign policy of the United States and the European Union, two bodies of government that play a signiﬁcant role in this emerging ﬁeld. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate the processes through which institutional structures interact with emerging ideas and bureaucratic interests in shaping water foreign policy. For example, while domestic water policies in the US, and EU policies for Member States, are largely integrated into the environmental policy agenda, the degradation of water eco-systems is largely neglected in water foreign policy in favor of geopolitical interests and international development targets. In asking why this is so, we situate water foreign policy as a conduit between domestic and global developments in water governance. We draw from a state-centric theory of environmental foreign policy which asserts that bureaucratic politics compete over policy preferences and impact outcomes (Barkdull and Harris, this volume). We begin with the premise that the US and the EU are both signiﬁcantly shaping the nature of water resource issues through hydrological, ﬁnancial, and political means, and therefore their actions and ideas will have a signiﬁcant impact on the world’s water resources. We develop concrete policy recommendations that could help move water foreign policy in these regions toward a more integrated and “green” policy stream. © 2009 Paul G.

The author extracts the general trends and common characteristics revealed by a vast body of empirical data, to construct a theoretical model of displacement and reconstruction. The model captures the socioeconomic content of both segments of the process: forced displacement and reestablishment. It identifies the key risks and impoverishment processes in displacement as: (a) landlessness; (b) joblessness; (c) homelessness; (d) marginalization; (e) food insecurity; (f) loss of access to common property resources; (g) increased morbidity; and (h) community disarticulation. Conversely, the model suggests that reconstructing and improving the livelihood of those displaced require risk-reversals through explicit strategies backed up by adequate financing. Flawed approaches to reconstruction and the intrinsic limitations of cost-benefit analysis are discussed. The paper shows how the proposed model can be used by practitioners and researchers as a diagnostic tool, a predictive tool, a problem-resolution tool and a research-guidance tool. © 1997 World Bank.

In an attempt to analyze a tendency Le Corbusier used to oppose earlier in his career, this paper also aims to argue that the Unité in Marseille was a breakthrough in his work followed by a new and final creative stage in his career devoid, however, of a meaningful vision of the basic architectural and urban planning tasks. After the problem of linking classical values with modern technology had been solved to a certain extent within the context of L'Esprit Nouveau in the 1920s, Le Corbusier changed his initial strategy in the 1930s. Slightly perceptible change and insecurity appeared for the first time in his work although this fluid change had little in common with a strong sense of uncertaintly that imbued his writings and dialogues in the 1950s. This was a period when a universal modern style in architecture and urban planning, based on the principles put forward by the CIAM (in particular the Athens chart) between the two world wars, came to an end. It is well known that Le Corbusier joined the neo-union leaders headed by Hubert Lagardelle and Philippe Lamour who were close to Saint-Simone's antiliberal technical élitists in the period before the dominance of L'Esprit Nouveau. Therefore the first changes in the 1930s were just a return to the earlier pre-Esprit tendencies. Political and ideological turning point initiated by the end of the war, which became noticeable in his work in the 1950s, resulted in his declarative orientation towards socialist principles. Nevertheless, he remained firmly committed to the evolutionary tendencies of the 1930s in terms of his style and aesthetics and was on the track of a creative breakthrough when - after disintegration of the L'Esprit Nouveau philosophy - he turned to classical, Platonic values relying on technology solely as a practical means of their implementation. Change and insecurity in his work became more intensive in the postwar period coinciding with the predominance of democratic principles in his still authoritative (and partly even totalitarian) way of thinking. Some implications of a relatively mild change of his political opinion and disappointment in collective ideologies became clearly visible in his aesthetics of exposed concrete and megaconstruction as an expression of ""democratic masses"". This concept was discussed by the end of the Second World War by Jose Louis Sert, Sigfried Giedion and Fernand Leger in their 1943 manifesto Nine Points on Monumentality as well as by Elizabeth Mock, a curator for architecture in MOMA in New York who in 1944 required monumental monuments of a ""democratic architecture"". In the 1950s James Stirling wrote two essays published in Architecture Review about Le Corbusier's work in this context, i.e. the context of organic design. In the last point of Nine Points of Monumentality, Sert, Giedion and Leger put forward their vision of a monumental structure that would be perceived beyond its functional aspect. It was meant to acquire almost lyrical values. Architecture and urban planning would in the near future win the so-called ""new freedom"" and reach a degree of creativity usually associated with painting, sculpture, music or poetry. Le Corbusier was the first to anticipate the manifesto aspirations and give a monumental character to a residential building. To present his concept of new monumentalism he chose a versatile material that can be easily formed by pouring it in a mould in order to build monumental and demanding structures. These ideas were already embodied in the guiding principles promoting whiteness and massive size in Vers une architecture in 1920. Le Corbusier's choice of a monumental expression for apartment blocks such as Unité in Marseille, built almost in the manner of a monument and his definition of aesthetic principles of apartment blocks in general (primarily in relation to the concept Roque and Rob) reflect all the complexity of Le Corbusier's approach: his ambiguous and even polysemic interpretation of a new aesthetics of a ""collective endeavour"" whose protagonists were organized hierarchically in a rigid social structure (the family) which is, similar to the Unité itself, closed within its own experimental preoccupations. The rigid scheme of Le Corbusier's concept of a family is in fact his definition of a ""new society"". This definition, published in OEuvre Complčte (1958), focused on two basic units: a social group as a form of community (unité) and on the other hand what we could call today a ""conventional family"". Moreover, it emphasizes a certain pre-civilization concept of a tribe organization. It was Le Corbusier's new concept of a postwar family. However, his rigid insistence on a particular model of housing and a concept of a community led him into the concept of an industrialized society based primarily on demographic growth and mass production. His approach might be therefore termed autocratic despite his declarative humane principles. In this context Robert Fishman elaborated his comparison with Rousseau whose work was criticized for having a certain authoritative (even a totalitarian) aspect based on his idea that the public will-power is a genuine expression of the will-power of all citizens. This is precisely the fundamental shortcoming of Le Corbusier's ""controlled family"". The elaboration of the topic of this paper points out that Le Corbusier entered a new, mature and complex creative stage much earlier than it was usually thought. This final stage of his career was coloured essentially by insecurity and doubt as well as a complex approach to urban planning (habitat) issues. This phase in his career started much earlier than the 10 th CIAM conference in Dubrovnik and a worldwide turning point encouraged by the members of Team 10 and even before the construction of the Marseille Unité. It was the period (late 1940s), when he finally chose his conception. At the same time a parallel process was going on: transformation of socialism into totalitarianism on the one hand and transformation of a co-housing unit (falanstere) into a form of prison on the other.","","","","","","13339117","","","","English","Prostor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863836738"

The context of drought and food insecurity in the mid-1980s and again in the early 2000s added a further rationale and impetus for organizing state-led resettlement programmes.

Literature reveals that in developing countries, food insecurity is a largely ''managed process'', meaning people are active participants in responding to the risks they face in life. This paper focuses on how households cope with food shortages and how these food coping strategies vary along the urban-rural continuum. A transect approach was used to guide data collection in and around the city of Tamale in northern Ghana. A total of 19 Focus Group discussions, having eight participants each (four women, four men), were conducted between March and May 2014. Additionally, three qualitative in-depth interviews were also conducted, one each in the urban, periurban and rural area. Results: In periurban and rural areas, gathering of wild food and selling of charcoal was widely practised, while in urban areas, most households tended to reduce the number of meals as a more frequent coping strategy. The study identified five coping strategies along the urban-rural continuum as the most severe in times of food insecurity, namely skipping a whole day without food, borrowing, buying food on credit, consuming seed stock and restricting adult intake in favour of children. Hunting, consuming less preferred food, taking occasional jobs and engaging in small trading were considered as not severe. Conclusions: Study results reveal that food coping strategies vary from one spatial entity to another in terms of frequency, severity and coping strategy indices along the urban-rural continuum. This information is useful for indicators to predict crisis (early warning), to understand shortfalls in access to adequate food (assessment), to allocate resources (targeting) or to track the impact of interventions (monitoring and evaluation). © 2016 Chagomoka et al.","Food coping strategies; Food insecurity; Transect approach; Urban-rural continuum","","T.

All of this takes place in an environment of global competition, regulatory harmonization, mergers and downsizing, and employee insecurity. Employees are expected to do more with less, work with more sophisticated equipment and processes, take more personal responsibility for quality and productivity, work in teams, etc. In summary, we are talking about CHANGE, the speed of which will accelerate in the years to come. This presentation will discuss how some pharmaceutical plants are addressing these challenges. Examples will be given in the areas of validation, process reengineering, risk analysis, role of the quality function and people. It is my contention that most of the global trends today are insufficient to meet the challenges that we face. I hope that this presentation will generate some ideas on what the global trends should be.","","Drug Industry; Humans; article; cost control; drug industry; good manufacturing practice; personnel management","","","","10797440","","JPHTE","9752708","English","PDA J.

The study also quantifies the potential effects of a similar weather extreme occurring in 2050 under climate change. The study results indicate that weather extremes that affect maize productivity in key grain baskets can negatively affect food security in vulnerable countries. The 2012 weather extreme which occurred in the USA reduced US and global maize production by 29% compared to trend; maize consumption in the country decreased by 5% only and this resulted in less surplus maize for exports from the largest maize exporter in the world. Global maize production decreased by 6% compared to trend. The decrease in global maize production coupled with a reduction in the volume of global maize exports worsened food insecurity in eastern Africa, the Caribbean and Central America and India. The effects of the weather extreme on global food security would be worse, if the latter were to occur under climate change in 2050, assuming no climate change adaptation worldwide over the years. In addition, the hardest-hit regions would remain the same, whether the weather extreme occurs in 2012 instead of 2050: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. However, sustained growth in per capita income across world economies between 2000 and 2050 would allow few countries in SSA and the LAC region to virtually eliminate hunger within their borders. In these countries, per capita income would be high enough by 2050 to completely offset the negative effect of the weather extreme. The study results are also consistent with USDA's estimates on US and global maize production and consumption in 2012 after the weather extreme. Some discrepancy is found on the volume of global maize trade; this implies that the bio-economic model likely overestimates the effect of the weather extreme on food insecurity. However, the trends from the analysis are likely to be valid. Further research would involve using a CGE model that can capture the net effects of weather extremes. © 2014 The Authors.","Developing world; Food security; IMPACT; Spatial bio-economic modelling; Weather extreme","","S.

Three key individuals led the way: Mahbub ul Haq, founder of the HDR and former Minister of Finance of Pakistan; and the distinguished economist-philosopher and Nobel laureate Professor Amartya Sen, an old friend of Mahbub ul Haq from their university days. The third person involved was Oscar Arias, twice President of Costa Rica and a leader who has often emphasized the benefits to a country of shifting expenditure from the military and weapons to education, health and other activities which directly benefit people. The 1994 UNDP Human Development Report conceptualized human security as peoplecentred, multi-dimensional, interconnected and universal. It encompassed a shift from security of the state by means of military defence of borders to the security of people, using various measures to counter a diversity of chronic threats, which included: ‘hunger, disease and repression and; protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions in the patterns of daily lives, whether in homes, jobs or communities’ (UNDP 1994). The HDR report detailed the kind of actions required to respond to these problems, including measures of disarmament to free up resources to make the new actions possible. Oscar Arias provided a quantified proposal for reducing military spending in all countries, rich and poor, by 3 per cent a year, with part of the proceeds put into a Global Demilitarization Fund to be used for supporting the process of de-mobilization in developing countries. (Note that 3 per cent was more or less the rate at which world military spending was being reduced when Arias was writing and the rate of reduction from 1989-1996.) Several reports on international policy followed which presented human security as a frame of reference for policy analysis and implementation. First and most significant was the Commission on Human Security (CHS), chaired by Amartya Sen and Mrs Sadako Ogata, who had been Executive Director of UNHCR from 1991-2001. This Commission produced the landmark study, Human Security Now (CHS 2003). Other significant formulations included the adoption of a human security framework in the report by the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan’s 2004 High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change (UN 2004), and in his subsequent report entitled In Larger Freedom – Towards Development Security and Human Rights for All (Annan 2005). Despite this, attempts to re-define security along the broader lines proposed in the 1994 HDR report have met with a cautious or sceptical reception from academic and policy worlds. However, recent events have increased such insecurities and have made them felt worldwide: Most notably, financial insecurities throwing whole countries into debt and recession, often with soaring levels of unemployment. To these have been added food insecurity and insecurities arising from climate change. Events in the United States since 2005 have demonstrated that no country is immune from such insecurities – whether in the form of major oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico which affected the livelihoods of fishermen, tourist operators and many others living along the coast or the ravages of Hurricane Katrina. These examples give growing credence to basic points about the concept of human security: It is about people, it is a universal concern, its components are interdependent and it is easier to ensure through early prevention than later intervention. The global dimensions of human security have also become clearer: Threats to environmental security from land degradation, deforestation – and of course the emission of greenhouse gases. In light of these and other changes in the global context of security, the limited and cautious reaction to the concept of human security in 1994 and subsequently looks even more surprising. However, as Keynes (1936) remarked about economists’ reactions to the General Theory: The ideas are extremely simple and should be obvious. The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds. © 2014 selection and editorial material, Mary Martin and Taylor Owen.","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","978-113461973-3; 978-041558128-8","","","English","Routledge Handb. of Hum.

However, a richer idea of human security has become increasingly important in the past decade or so. The aim is to incorporate various dimensions of the downside risks affecting the generalized well-being or dignity of people. Despite this rising prominence, the discourses surrounding human security have neglected to address the topic of gender, particularly how issues of poverty and underdevelopment impact women’s and men’s experiences and strategies differently. Since its introduction in the 1994 UNDP Human Development report, the idea of human security has become increasingly influential among academics and international development practitioners. However, gendered dimensions of human security have not attracted enough attention, despite their vital importance. Women are disproportionately more vulnerable to disease and other forms of human insecurity due to differences in entitlement, empowerment and an array of other ecological and socio-economic factors. These gendered insecurities are inextricably linked to poverty, and as a result, the feminization of poverty is a growing phenomenon worldwide. The contributors to this volume rely on a gender-focused analysis to consider a number of issues central to human security and development in Africa, including food security, environmental health risks, discrimination within judicial and legal systems, gendered aspects of HIV/AIDS transmission and treatment technologies, neoliberalism and poverty alleviation strategies, and conflict and women’s political activism. The gender focus of this volume points to the importance of power relationships and policy variability underlying human insecurities in the African context. The insights of this book offer the potential for an improved human security framework, one that embraces a more complex and context-specific analysis of the issues of risk and vulnerability, therefore expanding the capacities of the human security framework to safeguard the livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations. © 2012 Howard Stein and Amal Hassan Fadlalla","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","978-113628537-0; 978-041559784-5","","","English","Gendered Insecurities, Health and Development in Africa","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945666939"

Design/methodology/approach - A selection of apparel chain stores was made with the criterion of having more than ten shops to investigate fashion retailers' sites. The sites were rated by the results of Google's search engines on name. Six categories about the content of the site were taken to measure completeness and the developmental stage of these web sites. Findings - Retailer internet developments appear to be mainly complementary to their brick-and-mortar shop retail channel strategy. Of the interviewed consumers in The Netherlands 15 per cent had bought garments on the internet. Age and gender effects were not found. Inhibiting factors were security worries about payment, privacy and delivery, but the expected reasons such as fun, product information and fit, feel and look were less important. Research limitations/implications - Since factors that inhibit buying on the internet are mainly connected to internet technology and insecurity, the prediction of 25 per cent of the consumers buying garments on the internet is only justified if internet use and buying becomes more generally accepted by larger consumer groups. Practical implications - Apparel internet sales by retailers is a significantly growing retail channel. To be successful, retailers should take five recommendations seriously. Originality/value - This paper offers an overview of current apparel retail internet strategies and an analysis of consumer data about apparel buying. Results are interpreted to offer recommendations to apparel retailers in general.","Consumers; Electronic commerce; Fashion; Retailing; The Netherlands; Worldwide web","buying; consumer research; fashion; information technology; internet; retailing","R.P.

Although the health sector has a crucial role in addressing health inequalities, its efforts often come into conflict with powerful global actors in pursuit of other interests such as protection of national security, safeguarding of sovereignty, or economic goals. This is the starting point of The Lancet-University of Oslo Commission on Global Governance for Health. With globalisation, health inequity increasingly results from transnational activities that involve actors with different interests and degrees of power: states, transnational corporations, civil society, and others. The decisions, policies, and actions of such actors are, in turn, founded on global social norms. Their actions are not designed to harm health, but can have negative side-effects that create health inequities. The norms, policies, and practices that arise from global political interaction across all sectors that affect health are what we call global political determinants of health. The Commission argues that global political determinants that unfavourably affect the health of some groups of people relative to others are unfair, and that at least some harms could be avoided by improving how global governance works. There is an urgent need to understand how public health can be better protected and promoted in the realm of global governance, but this issue is a complex and politically sensitive one. Global governance processes involve the distribution of economic, intellectual, normative, and political resources, and to assess their effect on health requires an analysis of power. This report examines power disparities and dynamics across a range of policy areas that aff ect health and that require improved global governance: economic crises and austerity measures, knowledge and intellectual property, foreign investment treaties, food security, transnational corporate activity, irregular migration, and violent conflict. The case analyses show that in the contemporary global governance landscape, power asymmetries between actors with conflicting interests shape political determinants of health. We identified five dysfunctions of the global governance system that allow adverse eff ects of global political determinants of health to persist. First, participation and representation of some actors, such as civil society, health experts, and marginalised groups, are insufficient in decision-making processes (democratic deficit). Second, inadequate means to constrain power and poor transparency make it difficult to hold actors to account for their actions (weak accountability mechanisms). Third, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures are often impervious to changing needs and can sustain entrenched power disparities, with adverse eff ects on the distribution of health (institutional stickiness). Fourth, inadequate means exist at both national and global levels to protect health in global policy-making arenas outside of the health sector, such that health can be subordinated under other objectives (inadequate policy space for health). Lastly, in a range of policy-making areas, there is a total or near absence of international institutions (eg, treaties, funds, courts, and softer forms of regulation such as norms and guidelines) to protect and promote health (missing or nascent institutions). Recognising that major drivers of ill health lie beyond the control of national governments and, in many instances, also outside of the health sector, we assert that some of the root causes of health inequity must be addressed within global governance processes. For the continued success of the global health system, its initiatives must not be thwarted by political decisions in other arenas. Rather, global governance processes outside the health arena must be made to work better for health. The Commission calls for stronger cross-sectoral global action for health. We propose for consideration a Multistakeholder Platform on Governance for Health, which would serve as a policy forum to provide space for diverse stakeholders to frame issues, set agendas, examine and debate policies in the making that would have an eff ect on health and health equity, and identify barriers and propose solutions for concrete policy processes. Additionally, we call for the independent monitoring of how global governance processes aff ect health equity to be institutionalised through an Independent Scientific Monitoring Panel and mandated health equity impact assessments within international organisations. The Commission also calls for measures to better harness the global political determinants of health. We call for strengthened use of human rights instruments for health, such as the Special Rapporteurs, and stronger sanctions against a broader range of violations by nonstate actors through the international judicial system. We recognise that global governance for health must be rooted in commitments to global solidarity and shared responsibility through rights-based approaches and new frameworks for international financing that go beyond traditional development assistance, such as for research and social protection. We want to send a strong message to the international community and to all actors that exert influence in processes of global governance: we must no longer regard health only as a technical biomedical issue, but acknowledge the need for global cross-sectoral action and justice in our eff orts to address health inequity.","","Health Policy; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; International Cooperation; Politics; Power (Psychology); Socioeconomic Factors; World Health; abdominal pain; access to information; accident; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Africa south of the Sahara; article; Australia; budget; burn; Canada; catering service; climate change; compensation; conflict; Cyprus; death; decision making; depression; diabetes mellitus; disability; drug misuse; dyspnea; economic aspect; economic development; ethnicity; European Union; food crop; food industry; food insecurity; food security; government; Greece; gross national product; hazardous waste; headache; health care policy; health hazard; health service; hepatitis B; Hong Kong; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; human rights; immigrant; income; injury; intoxication; investment; Ireland; justice; law; lowest income group; malnutrition; maternal mortality; mental health; migration; money; morbidity; mortality; nausea; non communicable disease; nutrition; nutritional status; nutritional value; obesity; occupational disease; patent; political participation; political system; politics; pollution; population; Portugal; priority journal; protection; public-private partnership; risk reduction; smoking; social determinants of health; social exclusion; social status; social work; Spain; sustainable development; tobacco; tobacco use; toxic waste; tuberculosis; unemployment; violence; war; wellbeing; work environment","O.P.

Usually most research on this genre concentrates on high-income countries only, few studies include low- and middle-income countries, and even fewer examinations combine a large number of countries to obtain a worldwide view. For this, we need global welfare regime typologies that would allow for such examinations. Given this, we investigated the usefulness of the Wood and Gough welfare regime typology on 49 countries by examining the association between welfare regimes and self-reported individual disability worldwide. The World Health Survey data were examined on 207 818 people from 49 countries using the welfare regime classification developed by Wood and Gough. Multilevel logistic regression was used to investigate links between disability and welfare regimes while also accounting for individual-level socioeconomic factors. Variations in individual disability prevalence were found within the different welfare regimes. For example, odds of poor health prevalence for citizens within the insecurity Sub-Saharan African regime as compared with the European-conservative regime were OR=1.83 95 per cent CI: 0.85-3.95. Living in a state-organized regime was associated with lower odds of disability prevalence, as higher odds of disability prevalence were observed in all non-state regimes (with the exception of the productivist regime). For instance, the people in the productivist regime of East Asia reported similar prevalence of poor health odds as compared with the European-conservative regime (OR=0.94 95 per cent CI: 0.45-1.99). This short report found that the Wood and Gough typology enables the study of welfare regimes and health globally, and appears to be a useful tool in welfare regime type research. The productivist regime seems to have health protective features that are on par with European welfare state regimes. We recommend that this finding is investigated further in future empirical analyses. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","disability; global public health; multilevel models; welfare regimes; World Health Survey","","M.I.

The large-scale use of these means has prompted the creation of new needs in terms of analysis and interpretation. For this purpose, behavior recognition and scene understanding related applications have become more captivating to a significant number of computer vision researchers, particularly when crowded scenes are concerned. So far, motion analysis and tracking remain challenging due to significant visual ambiguities, which encourage looking into further keys. By this work, we present a new framework to recognize various motion patterns, extract abnormal behaviors and track them over a multi-camera traffic surveillance system. We apply a density-based technique to cluster motion vectors produced by optical flow, and compare them with motion pattern models defined earlier. Non-identified clusters are treated as suspicious and simultaneously tracked over an overlapping camera network for as long as possible. To aiming the network configuration, we designed an active camera scheduling strategy where camera assignment was realized via an improved Weighted Round-Robin algorithm. To validate our approach, experiment results are presented and discussed. © 2016, KoREMA.

Most of these people live in tropical, developing regions and rely on smallholder farming for food security. Solving the problem of food insecurity is thought to depend, in part, on managing ecosystem services, such as the pollination of crops and the biological control of crop pests, to enhance or maintain food production. Our knowledge regarding regulating ecosystem services in smallholder-farmed (or dualistic) landscapes is limited and whilst pollination has been the focus of considerable research, the provision of natural enemy services, important for every crop worldwide, has been relatively neglected. In order to assess whether ecosystem-service research adequately represents smallholder-farmed landscapes, whilst also considering climatic region and national economic status, we examined the constituent studies of recent quantitative reviews relevant to biological control and pollination. No regulating ecosystem service meta-analysis, to our knowledge, has focussed on smallholder agriculture despite its importance to billions of peoples' local food security. We found that whilst smallholdings contributed 16% of global farmland area and 83% of the global agricultural population (estimated using Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO's) World Census of Agriculture 2000) only 22 of 190 studies (12%) overall, came from smallholder-farmed landscapes. These smallholder studies mostly concerned coffee production (16 studies). Individual reviews of biological control were significantly and strongly biased towards data from large-scale farming in temperate regions. In contrast, pollination reviews included more smallholder studies and were more balanced for climate regions. The high diversity of smallholder-farmed landscapes implies that more research will be needed to understand them compared to large-scale landscapes, but we found far more research from the latter. We highlight that these skews in research effort have implications for sustainable intensification and the food security of billions in the developing world. In particular, we urge for balance in future ecosystem-services research and synthesis by greater consideration of a diverse range of smallholder-farmed landscapes in Africa and continental Asia. © 2014 Steward et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Biological control; Ecosystem service; Food security; Pollination; Smallholder; Sustainable intensification","","P.R.

Psychological knowledge can only be usefully applied by engaging with the qualities of society and by recognizing cultural diversity. Rather than focusing on practices which change individuals' attitudes and personal life choices, the emphasis here is on social and cultural changes that might improve everyone's happiness prospects. We also need to complement the analysis of pro-happiness practices in rich countries (so far also largely based on evidence from rich countries) with attention to changes that could promote happiness in poorer countries. Some examples of critical moments in the life course are presented and discussed to illustrate how the roles of key potential cheermongers are embedded in social and cultural contexts that constrain their potential as happiness promoters. These serve to remind us that although positive happiness promotion matters for everyone in the world, for the majority of the world's population the best prospects for improving happiness still lie in the removal of harms, provision of interim goods, and reduction of social injustices, enmities, and insecurities. Four key social qualities are recommended as a framework for understanding the potential for applying Positive Psychology at all levels: justice, solidarity, participation, and security. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","","N.

The present study assesses the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency and marginal deficiency in Colombian children and women and examines the sociodemographic correlates of serum vitamin B12 concentrations in these groups. Design Cross-sectional, nationally representative survey. Setting Colombia. Subjects Children <18 years old (n 7243), pregnant women (n 1781), and non-pregnant women 18-49 years old (n 499). Results The overall prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency (serum vitamin B12<148 pmol/l) and marginal deficiency (serum vitamin B12=148-221 pmol/l) was, respectively, 6·6 % (95 % CI 5·2 %, 8·3 %) and 22·5 % (95 % CI 21·1 %, 23·9 %). Pregnant women had the highest prevalence of deficiency (18·9 %; 95 % CI 16·6 %, 21·5 %) compared with non-pregnant adult women (18·5 %; 95 % CI 4·4 %, 53·1 %) and children (2·8 %; 95 % CI 2·3 % %, 3·3 %). In multivariable analyses among children, mean serum vitamin B12 was positively associated with female sex (12 pmol/l higher compared with males; P=0·004), secondary or higher education of the household head (12 pmol/l higher compared with primary or less; P=0·009) and food security (21 pmol/l higher compared with severe food insecurity; P=0·003). In multivariable analyses among pregnant women, mean serum vitamin B12 was positively associated with education of the household head and inversely associated with living in the National territories, Eastern or Pacific regions. Conclusions The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency and marginal deficiency in Colombian women and children is substantial. The burden falls largely on adult women, those with lowest education and those living in the poorest, most rural regions of the country.

Recent technological advances and innovations provide many opportunities to improve understanding of the way diverse types of plant virus epidemics develop and how to manage them. The review starts at the macro level by considering how recent innovations in remote sensing and precision agriculture can provide valuable information about (i) virus epidemics occurring at continental, regional or district scales (via satellites) and within individual crops (mostly via lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles), and (ii) exactly where to target control measures. It then considers recent improvements in information systems and innovations in modelling that improve (i) understanding of virus epidemics and ability to predict them, and (ii) delivery to end-users of critical advice on control measures, such as Internet-based Decision Support Systems. The review goes on to discuss how advances in analysis of spatiotemporal virus spread patterns within crops can help to enhance understanding of how virus epidemics develop and validate potentially useful virus control measures. At the micro level, the review then considers the many insights that advances in molecular epidemiology can provide about genetic variation within plant virus populations involved in epidemics, and how this variation drives what occurs at the macro level. Next, it describes how recent innovations in virus detection technologies are providing many opportunities to collect and analyse new types, and ever increasing amounts, of data about virus epidemics, and the genetic variability of the virus populations involved. Finally, the implications for plant virus epidemiology of technologies likely to be important in the future are considered. To address looming world food insecurity and threats to plant biodiversity resulting from climate change and rapid population growth, it is important that new and improved technologies that help understand and control epidemics of damaging plant viruses are adopted as smoothly and speedily as possible. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Ecology; Innovations; Management; Molecular epidemiology; New technologies","Agriculture; Aviation; Crops, Agricultural; Information Systems; Molecular Epidemiology; Molecular Typing; Plant Diseases; Plant Viruses; Plants; Remote Sensing Technology; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; article; genetic variability; molecular epidemiology; nonhuman; plant virus; precision agriculture; priority journal; remote sensing; virus detection; agriculture; aviation; crop; devices; genetics; growth, development and aging; information system; isolation and purification; molecular epidemiology; molecular typing; plant; plant disease; plant virus; prevention and control; procedures; spatiotemporal analysis; trends; utilization; virology","R.A.C.

Given a large and growing human population, the persistence of widespread malnutrition, and the direct and significant threats the expanding agricultural system poses to biodiversity, the goals of providing universal food security and protecting biodiversity seem incompatible. Examining the literature shows that the current agricultural system already provides sufficient food on a worldwide basis, but in doing so methodically undermines the capacity of agroecosystems to preserve biodiversity. However, the available evidence emphasizes the interdependence of biodiversity and agriculture, and the important role each plays in the maintenance of the other. Thus, our review supports the claim that the solutions to the problems of widespread food insecurity and biodiversity loss need not be mutually exclusive, and that it may be possible to address both using appropriate alternative agricultural practices. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agroecology; Alternative agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation; Food security; Organic agriculture; Political ecology","","M.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, on the United States have provoked feelings of insecurity and stress worldwide. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that maternal exposure to these acts of terrorism via the media had an unfavorable influence on mean birth weight in the Netherlands. Methods: We compared birth weights of 1885 Dutch neonates who were in utero during the attacks with those of 1258 neonates who were in utero exactly 1 year later. Results: In the exposed group, birth weight was lower than in the nonexposed group (difference, 48 g; 95% confidence interval=13.6, 82.9; P=.006). The difference in birth weight could not be explained by tobacco use, maternal age, parity, or other potential confounders or by shorter pregnancy durations.

Countries most affected by HIV are also stricken by elevated rates of food insecurity and malnutrition. HIV infection and insufficient nutritional intake are part of a vicious cycle that contributes to immunodeficiency and negative health outcomes. However, the effect of the overlap between HIV infection and undernutrition on the immune response following antiretroviral initiation remains unclear. A possible explanation could be the lack of consensus concerning the definition and assessment of nutritional status. Our objectives are to investigate the existence of an association between undernutrition and immune response at antiretroviral treatment initiation and the following year in low- and middle-income countries where malnutrition is most prevalent. Methods/design: Our systematic review will identify studies originating from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) published from 1996 onwards, through searches in MEDLINE (PubMed interface), EMBASE (OVID interface), Cochrane Central (OVID interface) and grey literature. No language restrictions will be applied. We will seek out studies of any design investigating the association between the nutritional status (for example, undernourished versus well nourished) and the immune response, either in terms of CD4 count or immune failure, in seropositive patients initiating antiretroviral therapy or in their first year of treatment. Two reviewers will independently screen articles, extract data and assess scientific quality using standardized forms and published quality assessment tools tailored for each study design. Where feasible, pooled measures of association will be obtained through meta-analyses. Results will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. This protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO database (registration number: CRD42014005961).Conclusion: Undernutrition and weight loss are prevalent amongst highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated patients in LMICs and contribute to excess early mortality. A possible intermediate pathway could be poor immune reconstitution secondary to deficient nutritional status. In the face of limited access to second line treatments, raising HIV resistance and cut backs to HIV programs, it is crucial to identify the factors associated with suboptimal response and therapeutic failure in order to better customize the care strategies employed in LMICs. © 2014 Sicotte et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","CD4; Highly active antiretroviral therapy; HIV; Low- and middle-income countries; Malnutrition; Protocol; Systematic review","Anti-HIV Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; HIV Infections; Humans; Nutrition Disorders; Nutritional Status; Treatment Outcome; albumin; antiretrovirus agent; C reactive protein; hemoglobin; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; Article; bibliographic database; CD4 lymphocyte count; data processing; disease association; fat free mass; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immune response; malnutrition; meta analysis (topic); nutritional status; outcome assessment; priority journal; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; survival; systematic review; virus resistance; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunology; nutritional disorder; review; treatment outcome","M.

Phytoplasmas as strictly biotrophic insect-transmitted bacterial pathogens instigate distinct changes in developmental processes and defence responses of the infected plants and manipulate plants to their own advantage; however, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying host–phytoplasma interactions. Further, phytoplasma-mediated transcriptional alterations in coconut palm genes have not yet been identified. This study evaluated the whole transcriptome profiles of naturally infected leaves of Cocos nucifera ecotype Malayan Red Dwarf in response to yellow decline phytoplasma from group 16SrXIV, using RNA-Seq technique. Transcriptomics-based analysis reported here identified genes involved in coconut innate immunity. The number of down-regulated genes in response to phytoplasma infection exceeded the number of genes up-regulated. Of the 39,873 differentially expressed unigenes, 21,860 unigenes were suppressed and 18,013 were induced following infection. Comparative analysis revealed that genes associated with defence signalling against biotic stimuli were significantly overexpressed in phytoplasma-infected leaves versus healthy coconut leaves. Genes involving cell rescue and defence, cellular transport, oxidative stress, hormone stimulus and metabolism, photosynthesis reduction, transcription and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were differentially represented. Our transcriptome analysis unveiled a core set of genes associated with defence of coconut in response to phytoplasma attack, although several novel defence response candidate genes with unknown function have also been identified. This study constitutes valuable sequence resource for uncovering the resistance genes and/or susceptibility genes which can be used as genetic tools in disease resistance breeding. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Coconut palm; De novo transcriptomics; Innate immunity; Malayan Red Dwarf ecotype; RNA-Seq; Yellow decline phytoplasma","Cocos; Genes, Plant; Immunity, Innate; Phytoplasma; Plant Leaves; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; transcriptome; Article; cell metabolism; coconut; gene control; nonhuman; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; Phytoplasma; plant disease; plant leaf; priority journal; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; transcriptomics; upregulation; coconut; genetics; immunology; innate immunity; microbiology; pathogenicity; Phytoplasma; plant gene; sequence analysis","N.

Since then activities in the livestock community have been associated with gene identification, gene mapping, QTL identification, genome-wide association studies and more recently the completion of initial sequencing of all the major livestock species. Many individual genes have been identified and incorporated into selection schemes in livestock, and more recently whole genome analysis and genomic selection have begun to be applied. The advent of cheaper, faster sequencing technologies and the realization of good draft sequences and development of SNP chip technologies for livestock species have contributed to our understanding on many ways to further improve our important food species. Such discoveries generally have benefitted three groups: livestock producers, consumers in the developed world and biomedical researchers. However, increased food insecurity and a worldwide food production crisis loom in the future as the most significant scientific challenge facing us in the next 30 years. Expectations are that human population growth will soon go from 7.3 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050, and food production must double despite evidence of climate change and limited land and water resources. There is a significant increased demand for animal source foods especially in the poorer countries of the developing world where most livestock are produced by small holders but also in countries like China and Brazil which are transforming quickly. Many researchers have touted that the genomic revolution offers solutions to increasing food in the developing world. These opportunities certainly exist, from identifying signatures of selection associated with adaptations for these environments to reducing susceptibility to major disease agents. Direction and focus of research, funding issues and human capacity training all will be required for success. Genomic discoveries will need to be embedded within sustainable programs that address implementation from the outset, and benefiting small holder production will be crucial to meeting this challenge. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Developing world; Food insecurity; Genomics; Livestock","Animalia","M.F.

Using the World Bank WDI database, we carry out a cross-country econometric analysis on the impact of income and non-income factors on child health in developing countries. Our main findings are threefold. First, among income factors, each country’s overall level of economic development is paramount, but income distribution also plays an important role. Second, each country’s relative propensity to spend on basic services is significantly and negatively correlated with child malnutrition and mortality. Third, women’s level of education and relative status play an important role. In the second section, on the basis of this general framework of interpretation of child health and human development outcomes in the developing world, we focus specifically on the performance of China and Vietnam in reducing under-five child malnutrition and mortality. Under the market socialist model, both countries achieved very high rates of GDP growth, and managed to decrease significantly the prevalence of malnutrition. However, China’s progress in reducing child mortality was relatively slow in the 1980s and 1990s, before improving in the early 2000s. Vietnam’s record was markedly better, notwithstanding the fact that Vietnam is still much poorer than its giant Northern neighbour. We show that this apparent paradox is due mainly to the negative sideeffects of market-oriented reforms, which have reached a more advanced stage in China than in Vietnam. Our results also suggest that the relatively better status of women in Vietnam with respect to China is an additional factor. This phenomenon appears to have been exacerbated by the perverse effects of China’s rigid population control policies, and by the increasingly, uncontrolled and quasi-privatized availability of advanced medical services. In the policy conclusions, we criticize the market-oriented bias of social sectors reforms, and advocate in favour of recovering some essential features of the original socialist approach, which had been particularly effective in the crucial task of providing universally accessible basic public services. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Child health; China and Vietnam; Food insecurity; Malnutriton; Millennium development goals; Mortality; Simultaneous equations","","F.

The main objective of this study was to examine the food security dynamics and model household food insecurity. The Rasch modelling approach was employed on a dataset from a sample of 1175 (Tororo = 577; Busia = 598) randomly selected households in the year 2010. All households provided responses to the food security questions and none was omitted from the analysis. At 5 percent level of significance the analysis indicated that Tororo district average food security assessment (0.137 ± 0.181) was lower than that for Busia district (0.768 ± 0.177). All the mean square fit statistics were in the range of 0.5 to 1.5, and none of them showed any signs of distortion, degradation, or less productivity for measurement. This confirmed that items used in this study were very productive for measurement of food security in the study area. The study recommends further analysis where item responses are ordered polytomous rather than the dichotomous item response functions used. Furthermore, consideration should be given to fit models that allow for different latent distributions for households with children and those without children and possibly other subgroups of respondents. © 2014 Abraham Owino et al.","","","A.

About 850 million people were undernourished worldwide during the period 2006-2008, including 129.6 million people, or 10 percent of the population, in China (FAO, 2011, pp. 45-46).

Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Methods: Participants were enrolled from the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes cohort, and underwent quarterly structured interviews and blood draws. The primary predictor was food insecurity measured by the validated Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Primary outcomes included health-related quality of life measured by the validated Medical Outcomes Study-HIV Physical Health Summary (PHS), incident self-reported opportunistic infections, number of hospitalizations, and missed clinic visits. To estimate model parameters, we used the method of generalized estimating equations, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables. Explanatory variables were lagged by 3 months to strengthen causal interpretations. Results: Beginning in May 2007, 458 persons were followed for a median of 2.07 years, and 40% were severely food insecure at baseline. Severe food insecurity was associated with worse PHS, opportunistic infections, and increased hospitalizations (results were similar in concurrent and lagged models). Mild/moderate food insecurity was associated with missed clinic visits in concurrent models, whereas in lagged models, severe food insecurity was associated with reduced odds of missed clinic visits. Conclusion: Based on the negative impact of food insecurity on morbidity and patterns of healthcare utilization among HIV-infected individuals, policies and programs that address food insecurity should be a critical component of HIV treatment programs worldwide. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health.","AIDS; food insecurity; healthcare utilization; HIV; morbidity; Uganda","Adult; AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections; Cohort Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Food Supply; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Hospitalization; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Morbidity; Patient Compliance; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; RNA, Viral; Rural Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Uganda; Viral Load; antiretrovirus agent; adult; article; blood analysis; female; follow up; food availability; food insecurity; health care; health care utilization; health status; hospitalization; household; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; morbidity; outpatient department; priority journal; quality of life; rural area; self report; structured interview; treatment outcome; Uganda","S.D.

Thus, the analyzed variables were obtained in this study, including nutritional indices, food insecurity and other socioeconomic and demographic variables. The height-for-age, weight-for-age and weight-for-height indices were evaluated as the z-score of the World Health Organization reference curves. Food insecurity was defined by using the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Averages of three indices according to the presence of food insecurity were analyzed, including other variables. Linear regression evaluated the effect of food insecurity on the z-score of the three nutritional indices. Results: The sample included 4,817 children, out of whom 7% had deficit in height, 7% were overweight and 47% had food insecurity. It was found that the average of height for-age, weight-for-age and weight-for-height were-0.31, 0.12 and 0.40, respectively, being lower among children with food insecurity. Conclusion: The regression analysis showed that children living with some level of food insecurity have worse rates of height-for-age, even controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors.","Anthropometry; Body height; Child development; Food and nutritional security; Nutritional transition","Body Height; Body Weight; Brazil; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Supply; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Nutritional Status; body height; body weight; Brazil; catering service; cross-sectional study; female; human; infant; male; newborn; nutritional status; preschool child","L.

History textbooks used to be anchored in national traditions, ultimately legitimizing the rationale of nation-states. In questioning the sole validity of national history, social movements since the 1960s and the process of globalization became the seedbeds for the deconstruction of master narratives. Because of their instrumental character as teaching tools, textbooks in general allow researchers to decipher the normative structures of societies. The information revolution since the 1970s has dethroned textbooks as the sole means of instruction in classrooms, and led to the development of different approaches for the analysis of textbooks. Today's globalizing world demands new reference frames for teaching and learning. In the second part of this article, eight clusters that are pertinent for orientation in the perplexing realities of the present are drafted: challenges resulting from the revolution in information technologies the changing world of work contradictory tendencies in globalizing processes the impact of a new turbo-capitalism with its de-legitimizing impact on political systems unequal developments leading to an ever increasing inequality on a global as well as on local levels the increase of worldwide migration and its impact on classrooms contested memories in societies that reposition themselves in a world that has grown together and re-fragmented at new seams and finally, the crisis in orientation and values and the personal costs resulting from the perplexities and insecurities of the world. © GEI.","Collective memory; Global consciousness; Globalization; Teaching; Textbook research; Textbooks; Unequal global development; World history","","","","Berghahn Journals","20416938","","","","English","J.

Assessing children's growth is a meaningful way of studying a population's nutritional status. This study investigated (1) the association between stunting, chronic malnutrition, and food insecurity among school age children in rural Honduras and (2) the relationship between stunted growth and physical indicators of malnutrition. All school age children in 5 communities were assessed for physical indicators of malnutrition. Household interviews were performed with a subsample to collect information related to parental and household characteristics, food intake, and food insecurity. Means were compared for stunted versus nonstunted children, and bivariate correlation analyses were performed to investigate a relationship between food insecurity, stunting, and physical indicators of malnutrition. There was a correlation between stunting and one measure of food insecurity, and stunting and several physical indicators of malnutrition were related, including midarm circumference (P < .05), hair thickness (P < .05), hair color (P < .01), skin discoloration (P < .01), pot belly (P < .01), and thin limbs (P < .01). Because stunted growth was associated with physical indicators of malnutrition, measures to address stunting are warranted. Further research is needed to substantiate the importance of stunted growth as an indicator of long-term health, but our research clearly shows that stunted growth is related to physical indicators of malnutrition, which reveal poor short-term health. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It is estimated that in total (including those displaced prior to the war) there may be as many as 2 million Iraqi refugees who have fled to Jordan, Syria, and other neighboring states, and approximately 2.7 million Iraqis who have been displaced within Iraq itself. Some experts think that the Iraq situation now outpaces other refugee crises worldwide. During 2004-2007, the violence and insecurity resulting from the ongoing sectarian strife, terrorism, and insurgency in Iraq produced substantial civilian displacement in different parts of the country. Many of Iraq's neighbors fear that they are being overwhelmed by refugees who have fled over Iraq's borders. There are heightened concerns about the absorptive capacity of neighboring countries, whether they can provide adequately for the populations that have moved across borders, and the impact of refugee flows on stability in general. While there is clear evidence of limited improvement in Iraq - decreasing violence, reduced levels of displacement, and a handful of returns in a few governorates - the situation in general remains precarious and requires sustained attention. UNHCR estimates that the number of Iraqis displaced within Iraq who need food and shelter exceeds 1 million people. This report provides an analysis of the current crisis, including the conditions for those displaced in Iraq and the refugee situations in Syria, Jordan, and elsewhere. It also provides information on the U.S. and international response and examines refugee resettlement options in the United States. Aspects of this crisis that may be of particular interest to the 110th Congress include a focus on an immediate response (providing humanitarian relief funding), examining resettlement policies, and developing a strategy to manage the displaced, particularly within Iraq. This report will be updated as events warrant.

This is in response to increasing food insecurity and poverty in the world. The incidences of food insecurity and poverty are particularly devastating in the developing countries and a lot of resources are being channelled towards programmes aimed at eradicating food insecurity and poverty by various international organizations and government of the developing nations. In terms of food insecurity, 852 million people worldwide are still chronically undernourished. In Africa, an estimated 200 million or 27.4% of the people on the continent are undernourished. This figure is expected to increase to 30% by 2010. In Nigeria, over 40% of the estimated population of 133 million people are food insecure. To achieve the Millennium Development Goals of halving the proportion of hungry people by 2015, it was projected that 22 million people must achieve food security every year. In consonance of the above, this study examined the socio-economic characteristics and determinants of the food security status of rural farming households in Kwara State of Nigeria. The study utilized a three-stage random sampling technique to obtain a sample of 94 farm households and a cross sectional data in year 2005. Descriptive analysis was carried out to describe the socio-economic characteristics of the households. Econometric tools were used to determine factors affecting the food security status of household. Using the recommended calorie required approach; the study revealed that 36% and 64% of the households were food secure and food insecure respectively. The Shortfall/Surplus index showed that the food secure households exceeded the recommended calorie intake by 42%, while the food insecure households fell short of the recommended calorie intake by 38%. A logit regression model made up of eight regressors was specified. Household income, household size, educational status of household's head and quantity of food obtained from own production were found to determine the food security status of farming households in the study area. It is concluded that the design of food security strategies should be multi-dimensional such that would focus on and address the identified determinants in order to achieve the target set by the Millennium Development Goals. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2007.","Farming household; Food insecurity; Food security; Logistic regression; North central Nigeria","agricultural worker; article; caloric intake; controlled study; developing country; education; family size; food security; household; incidence; income; malnutrition; Nigeria; poverty; random sample; regression analysis; rural area; socioeconomics","","","Asian Network for Scientific Information","16805194","","","","English","Pak.

Such issues are highly gendered in territories with majorities of indigenous populations where overlapping legal regimes (statutory, multicultural, customary) and histories of dispossession have created complex spatialities and access patterns. States' formalization of indigenous rights, neoliberal restructuring and land appropriation are the backdrop to Ecuadorian women's struggles to access, retain and pass on land. Despite a burgeoning literature on Latin American indigenous territories, women are often invisible. Using collaborative research among two indigenous nationalities, the article analyses the political-economic, legal and de facto regimes shaping women's claims to land and indigenous territory. Focusing on Kichwa women in the rural Andes and Tsáchila women in a tropical export-oriented agricultural frontier area, the article examines the criteria and exclusionary practices that operate at multiple scales to shape women's (in)security in tenure. Women's struggles over claims to land and territory are also discussed.

Research in mid- and high-income settings suggests that coworker collaboration increases productivity and performance. A major gap in this research, however, is the exploration of factors that influence teamwork among diverse community health worker cadres in rural, low-resource settings. The purpose of this study is to examine how sociodemographic and structural factors shape teamwork among community-based maternal and newborn health workers in Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with health extension workers, community health development agents, and traditional birth attendants in 3 districts of the West Gojam Zone in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Communities were randomly selected from Maternal and Newborn Health in Ethiopia Partnership (MaNHEP) sites; health worker participants were recruited using a snowball sampling strategy. Fractional logit modeling and average marginal effects analyses were carried out to identify the influential factors for frequency of work interactions with each cadre. Results: One hundred and ninety-four health workers participated in the study. A core set of factors-trust in coworkers, gender, and cadre-were influential for teamwork across groups. Greater geographic distance and perception of self-interested motivations were barriers to interactions with health extension workers, while greater food insecurity (a proxy for wealth) was associated with increased interactions with traditional birth attendants. Discussion: Interventions that promote trust and gender sensitivity and improve perceptions of health worker motivations may help bridge the gap in health services delivery between low- and high-resource settings. Inter-cadre training may be one mechanism to increase trust and respect among diverse health workers, thereby increasing collaboration. Large-scale, longitudinal research is needed to understand how changes in trust, gender norms, and perceptions of motivations influence teamwork over time. © 2014 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.","Community health workers; Ethiopia; Health services; Maternal health; Motivations; Teamwork; Trust","Adult; Aged; Community Health Workers; Cooperative Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Collection; Delivery of Health Care; Ethiopia; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Health Services; Middle Aged; Midwifery; Motivation; Pregnancy; Rural Health Services; Rural Population; Sexism; Social Class; Trust; Workplace; Young Adult; adult; article; community health development agent; controlled study; cross-sectional study; Ethiopia; female; food insecurity; health auxiliary; health care delivery; health care quality; health extension worker; health service; human; job performance; male; maternal care; perception; priority journal; rural area; teamwork; traditional birth attendant; trust; workplace; aged; cooperation; health care delivery; health service; information processing; middle aged; midwife; motivation; newborn; pregnancy; rural health care; rural population; sexism; social class; trust; young adult","M.M.

They are recurring problems in certain regions of the US, as well as in many parts of the world. According to nation-wide surveys conducted by the US Bureau of the Census, between 1996 and 1998 an estimated 9.7% of US households were classified as food insecure (6.2% being food insecure without evidence of hunger, and 3.5% being food insecure with moderate to severe hunger). This means that approximately 10 million households each year did not always have access to enough food to meet basic needs. A potential tool in the fight against food insecurity and hunger is information technology (IT), since its use and range of application continue to grow at astonishing rates. The study presented here examined the question of how information technology, particularly the Internet, can be used to promote food security. The study used an action science research approach, and a case study strategy, with the food security system of Oktibbeha County, Mississippi selected as the case for study. The research design was a two-phase process. Phase one consisted of a needs assessment among food assistance organizations in Oktibbeha County, and included interviews of key food assistance personnel. Phase one also included a survey of IT subject matter experts to seek their opinions about the current state of Web-based information technology. Phase two involved an analysis of various IT implementation issues, as well as the development of a Web-based food security information system prototype tool. The needs assessment results indicated that (a) certain food security system and information needs existed among the food assistance organizations in Oktibbeha County, and (b) appropriate information technologies existed that could be applied to these needs. The food security needs related to better communication and coordination of information, such as program information, food site inventory information, client history information, food donation information, and nutrition education information. In regard to technology development, a variety of scenarios were examined. These included client-side approaches, server-side approaches, simple e-mail-based systems, Java-based systems, systems based on the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), and commercial database systems. In applying the needs assessment and survey results, the researcher developed a prototype Web site (including a series of online database tools) that could be used to promote food security in counties such as Oktibbeha County. The results of this research show that appropriate, Internet-based, IT holds promise for the reduction of certain social problems, such as food insecurity and hunger. © 2004 Stephen E.

Although food insecurity is an important determinant of child nutrition, including stunting, development of universal measures has been challenging due to cumbersome nutritional questionnaires and concerns about lack of comparability across populations. We investigate the relationship between household food access, one component of food security, and indicators of nutritional status in early childhood across eight country sites.Methods: We administered a socioeconomic survey to 800 households in research sites in eight countries, including a recently validated nine-item food access insecurity questionnaire, and obtained anthropometric measurements from children aged 24 to 60 months. We used multivariable regression models to assess the relationship between household food access insecurity and anthropometry in children, and we assessed the invariance of that relationship across country sites.Results: Average age of study children was 41 months. Mean food access insecurity score (range: 0-27) was 5.8, and varied from 2.4 in Nepal to 8.3 in Pakistan. Across sites, the prevalence of stunting (42%) was much higher than the prevalence of wasting (6%). In pooled regression analyses, a 10-point increase in food access insecurity score was associated with a 0.20 SD decrease in height-for-age Z score (95% CI 0.05 to 0.34 SD; p = 0.008). A likelihood ratio test for heterogeneity revealed that this relationship was consistent across countries (p = 0.17).Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of the validity of using a simple household food access insecurity score to investigate the etiology of childhood growth faltering across diverse geographic settings. Such a measure could be used to direct interventions by identifying children at risk of illness and death related to malnutrition. © 2012 Psaki et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Nepal; Pakistan; child health; diet; food intake; food security; malnutrition; morality; morbidity; questionnaire survey; article; child; child nutrition; correlation analysis; correlational study; food availability; food security; health care survey; human; malnutrition; Nepal; Pakistan; preschool child; priority journal; questionnaire; stunting; wasting syndrome","W.

The collection emphasizes contemporary developments, but also provides historical context on nation-state membership as the fundamental means for accessing rights in an era of expanding temporariness - in recognition of why pathways to permanence remain so compelling. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, contributors explore various dimensions of temporariness, especially as it relates to the legal status of migrants and refugees, to the spread of precarious employment, and to limitations on social rights. While the focus is on Canada, a number of chapters investigate and contrast developments in Canada with those in Europe as well as Australia and the United States. Together, these essays reveal changing and enduring temporariness at local, regional, national, transnational, and global levels, and in different domains, such as health care, language programs, and security. The question at the heart of this collection is whether temporariness can be liberated from current constraints. While not denying the desirability of permanence for migrants and labourers, Liberating Temporariness? presents alternative possibilities of security and liberation. © McGill-Queen's University Press 2014.","","","","","McGill University","","978-077359222-3; 978-077354381-2","","","English","Lib.

It is normally aggravated due to large disturbance. Due to deregulation of power system, the system has to cater for the load bids in open access. This may cause the increased transaction level leading to more stress on the power system. It has become an urgent need of today to address the voltage stability problems to keep the voltage profile under control. Several incidences of voltage instability have occurred worldwide recently. In the event of contingency, the most serious threat to operation and control of power system is insecurity. The estimation of the power system state under contingency is an essential task for the power system engineers. The contingency analysis technique is a prerequisite to predict the effects of various contingencies like failure of transformers, transmission lines, etc. It helps to initiate necessary control actions to maintain power system security, reliability and stability. In the present work, two kinds of performance indices viz. active power performance index and reactive power performance index are computed for a large power system using a special code written in MATLAB environment. Furthermore, a novel idea of static voltage stability analysis by incrementing the load in proportion to the original load on load buses along with the most vulnerable line outage using Newton Raphson (N-R) load flow is presented. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a richer idea of human security has become increasingly important in the past decade or so. The aim is to incorporate various dimensions of the downside risks affecting the generalized well-being or dignity of people. Despite this rising prominence, the discourses surrounding human security have neglected to address the topic of gender, particularly how issues of poverty and underdevelopment impact women’s and men’s experiences and strategies differently. Since its introduction in the 1994 UNDP Human Development report, the idea of human security has become increasingly influential among academics and international development practitioners. However, gendered dimensions of human security have not attracted enough attention, despite their vital importance. Women are disproportionately more vulnerable to disease and other forms of human insecurity due to differences in entitlement, empowerment and an array of other ecological and socio-economic factors. These gendered insecurities are inextricably linked to poverty, and as a result, the feminization of poverty is a growing phenomenon worldwide. The contributors to this volume rely on a gender-focused analysis to consider a number of issues central to human security and development in Africa, including food security, environmental health risks, discrimination within judicial and legal systems, gendered aspects of HIV/AIDS transmission and treatment technologies, neoliberalism and poverty alleviation strategies, and conflict and women’s political activism. The gender focus of this volume points to the importance of power relationships and policy variability underlying human insecurities in the African context. The insights of this book offer the potential for an improved human security framework, one that embraces a more complex and context-specific analysis of the issues of risk and vulnerability, therefore expanding the capacities of the human security framework to safeguard the livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations. © 2013 Bruce Lankford, Karen Bakker, Mark Zeitoun, and Declan Conway, selection and editorial material; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","978-113628586-8; 978-041553470-3","","","English","Water Security: Principles, Perspectives and Practices","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84917740020"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between novel modifiable risk factors and TB in Indian children. DESIGN: Cases were children aged ≤5 years with c onfirmed/probable TB based on World Health Organization definitions (definition 1). Controls were healthy children aged ≤5 years. Logistic regression was performed to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of being a TB case given exposure, including indoor air pollution (IAP; exposure to tobacco smoke and/or biomass fuels) and vitamin D deficiency. Cases were re-analyzed according to a new consensus research definition of pediatric TB (definition 2). RESULTS: Sixty cases and 118 controls were enrolled.Both groups had high levels of vitamin D deficiency (55% vs. 50%, P = 0.53). In multivariable analysis, TB was associated with household TB exposure (aOR 25.41, 95%CI 7.03-91.81), household food insecurity (aOR 11.55, 95%CI 3.33-40.15) and IAP exposure (aOR 2.67, 95%CI 1.02-6.97), but not vitamin D deficiency (aOR 1.00, 95%CI 0.38-2.66). Use of definition 2 reduced the number of cases to 25. In multivariate analysis, TB exposure, household food insecurity and IAP remained associated with TB.

GM crops could contribute to food production increases and higher food availability. There may also be impacts on food quality and nutrient composition. Finally, growing GM crops may influence farmers' income and thus their economic access to food. Smallholder farmers make up a large proportion of the undernourished people worldwide. Our study focuses on this latter aspect and provides the first ex post analysis of food security impacts of GM crops at the micro level. We use comprehensive panel data collected over several years from farm households in India, where insect-resistant GM cotton has been widely adopted. Controlling for other factors, the adoption of GM cotton has significantly improved calorie consumption and dietary quality, resulting from increased family incomes. This technology has reduced food insecurity by 15-20% among cotton-producing households. GM crops alone will not solve the hunger problem, but they can be an important component in a broader food security strategy.","","Adult; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Data Collection; Energy Intake; Food Supply; Gossypium; Humans; India; Middle Aged; Plants, Genetically Modified; Gossypium hirsutum; Hexapoda; article; caloric intake; food availability; food composition; food intake; food quality; food security; household; human; income; India; nutrient content; nutritional value; transgenic plant; adult; agriculture; catering service; crop; genetics; Gossypium; information processing; middle aged; transgenic plant","M.

We aimed to analyse anthropometric indicators for childhood and maternal nutrition at a district level in Pakistan and assess the association of nutritional status with food security and maternal and household socioeconomic factors. Methods: We used data from the 2011 Pakistan National Nutrition Survey, which included anthropometric measurements for 33638 children younger than 5 years and 24 826 women of childbearing age. We estimated the prevalences of stunting, wasting, and underweight among children and of underweight, overweight, and obesity in women for all 143 districts of Pakistan using a Bayesian spatial technique. We used a mixed-effect linear model to analyse the association of nutritional status with individual and household sociodemographic factors and food security. Findings: Stunting prevalence in Pakistan's districts ranged between 22% (95% credible interval 19-26) and 76% (69-83); the lowest figures for wasting and underweight were both less than 2·5% and the highest were 42% (34-50) for wasting and 54% (49-59) for underweight. In 106 districts, more women were overweight than were underweight; in 49 of these districts more women were obese than were underweight. Children were better nourished if their mothers were taller or had higher weight, if they lived in wealthier households, and if their mothers had 10 or more years of education. Severe food insecurity was associated with worse nutritional outcomes for both children and women. Interpretation: We noted large social and geographical inequalities in child and maternal nutrition in Pakistan, masked by national and provincial averages. Pakistan is also beginning to face the concurrent challenge of high burden of childhood undernutrition and overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age. Planning, implementation, and evaluation of programmes for food and nutrition should be based on district-level needs and outcomes.

In many parts of the US, this land use conversion has in some cases resulted in subdivision of farms into large residential parcels. Some of these residential parcels may retain sizeable areas of undeveloped prime agricultural soil. In an uncertain future challenged by population growth, climate change, food insecurity, water shortages, and energy limitations, communities are beginning to explore their ability to feed themselves from local supplies. Addressing this issue will require additional tools for planning land use in a way that could support greater food self-sufficiency at the community level. In this study, a process was developed to identify, quantify and classify agricultural opportunities (AO). AO are simply open lands suitable for some level of agricultural production.The methods outlined here were developed in Chittenden County, Vermont but they can be applied elsewhere. While individual ancillary datasets may be unique to each study area, the general process can be replicated as long as some basic datasets such as classified land cover imagery and prime soils are available. The tools described herein, if employed by planners or geospatial analysts, can generate actionable information. The results of the analyses, as well as the associated participatory community discussions, can aid decision makers when drafting new or revising old policies. Because of their widespread applicability, these tools can serve as decision support aids for policy makers and planners tasked with developing strategies to increase food self-sufficiency. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural neighborhood; Agricultural opportunity; Cluster analysis; Embedded agriculture; Food security; Land inventory","Chittenden County; United States; Vermont; Agricultural robots; Climate change; Cluster analysis; Decision making; Decision support systems; Food supply; Housing; Land use; Planning; Population statistics; Agricultural neighborhood; Agricultural opportunity; Agricultural soils; Commercial development; Developing strategy; Energy limitations; Food security; Population growth; agricultural land; agricultural production; agricultural soil; climate change; cluster analysis; data set; decision making; food security; inventory; land cover; land use planning; population growth; residential development; urbanization; Agriculture","D.L.

We discover several vulnerabilities in both its control-plane and dataplane functions, which can be exploited to disrupt both data and voice in operational networks. In particular, we find that the adversary can easily gain free data access, shut down continuing data access, or subdue an ongoing call, etc. We validate these proof-of-concept attacks using commodity smartphones (rooted and unrooted) in two Tier-1 US mobile carriers.

The GATS is a multilateral trade agreement that promotes the gradual liberalization of international trade in services (for example, banking, education, accounting and retailing). Even though there was little consultation with national or local governments about the implications of GATS for domestic regulatory authorities, when national governments originally signed up to the GATS in 1994, they undertook to ensure that all levels of government conformed to the agreement. Its mandate is based on the rule of anti-discrimination toward foreign traders and the removal of ŉon-tariff barriers’. These allow the WTO to limit national laws/regulations that favour domestic actors. For example, in the case of retail and wholesale service (under Mode Three on commercial presence abroad), the GATS rules means that global supermarket chains that establish shops can challenge local rules (number of stores, their locations, opening hours and land use laws) as barriers to trade. This legal ‘softening’ of the local laws helps multinational chains to enter the markets in developed and developing countries alike (see also Sum 2010). Second, Wal-Mart has formed glocal partnerships. It has entered national markets through partnerships with local governments, for example, the stateowned Shenzhen International Trusts and Investment Company in China, and commercial concerns such as ASDA in the United Kingdom (UK) and Bharti Enterprises in India. These and other ventures enable Wal-Mart to sell in these countries as well as source from them. Focusing on its sourcing, more than 70 per cent of all goods sold by Wal-Mart were made in China, with Chinese exports to Wal-Mart estimated at approximately US$25 billion for 2006 (Gereffi and Ong 2007: 48). Wake Up Wal-Mart.com called this the ‘ultimate joint venture’.1 In statistical terms, this ‘joint venture’ means that Wal-Mart is the ‘Number One Importer of Chinese Goods’ into the United States (US). Between 2001 and 2006, Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 9.6 per cent of total US imports from China (Scott 2007). These data indicate not only China’s importance for the expansion of Wal-Mart but also the role of the arrangements between Wal-Mart and its suppliers in competing on bargain-based accumulation strategies. Third, underlying these strategies is the use of micromanagement techniques and information technology that integrate retailing with the global supply chain. Wal-Mart has developed its own communication-logistical-inventory system that enables it to link the retailer with its suppliers worldwide. Since 1983, Wal-Mart has installed barcode readers in all its distribution centres; it followed this up with radio-frequency identification from 2005. It also introduced a software programme in 1991 called Retail Link that connects all stores, distribution centres and suppliers. This innovation has made Wal-Mart into the largest private satellite communication operator in the world. It operates a four-petabyte data warehouse that collects and analyses point-of-sale (POS) data (for example, store number, item number, selling amount, selling cost), as well as keeping track of inventory down to item level. These capacities allow Wal-Mart and its suppliers to examine and forecast consumer demand patterns as well as to coordinate product sales and inventory data through the Retail Link system since 1996. Mainstream economic and management studies argue that this technological prowess enables Wal-Mart to ‘share information’ with its suppliers and gain cost advantages based on automation, joint demand forecasting and the ‘just-in-time’ supply system (for example barcode-triggered replenishment, vendor-managed inventory and faster inventory turnover time) (Holmes 2001; Basker 2007). However, this kind of ‘information sharing’ in lean retailing (Bonacich and Wilson 2006: 234-5) can also be employed coercively (Free 2006: 14-16; 2007: 900). Given that price-value and cost competitiveness drive supply chains of this kind (Christopher 2005: 123), the everyday operations of mega retailers are based on particular calculating practices that manage costs and margins. More specifically, these practices include ‘category management’ and ‘activity-based costing’. ‘Category management’, which is a business practice that began in the supermarket business, allows giant retailers to improve sales and profits by managing product categories (for example, apparel, toys) as separate business units. For Spector (2005: 77), this practice allows supermarkets ‘to oversee the store not as aggregation of products, but rather as an amalgam of categories, with each category unique in how it is priced and how it is expected to perform over time’. Wal-Mart began its own category management in the food sector and then extended it to other products. This practice allows a retailer to work with its supplier(s) to develop category plan(s) that ‘determine its place within the store; evaluate its performance by setting goals; identify target consumer; divine the best way to merchandise, stock, and display the category’ (Spector 2005: 77-8). Category captains (formerly called ‘buyers’) and category managers are appointed to facilitate these routine retailer-supplier contacts, in the case of WalMart, via the Retail Link. For example, a Hong Kong-based export sourcing firm, called Li and Fung Limited, was Wal-Mart’s ‘category captain’ on its clothes, toys and home furnishings categories (for details of Li and Fung, see Christopher 2005: 293-4). In 2010, Li and Fung set up a new company to deal with Wal-Mart’s account (Cheng 2010). Underlying ‘category management’ is a range of calculating practices of ‘activity-based costing’ concerned with monitoring the profitability of each product category (Christopher 2005: 111). To improve profitability and efficiency, suppliers are required to open their accounts to retailers (called ‘open book accounting’) with the aim of coordinating activities to reduce costs and/or maximize margins. In the case of Wal-Mart, suppliers’ managers are trained through a help desk and classes (organized in-house or outsourced) to submit reports to its Retail Link on matters such as inventory, pricing, performance, sales and promotion. Supplier scorecards have a key role in managing the mass of information that is assembled. As a form of selective knowing, they capture the financial details of demand-pull supply chain (Christopher 2005). Scorecards allow Wal-Mart category managers (and their assistants) keyhole views into the suppliers’ ‘sales’, ‘markdown’, ‘margins’, ‘inventory’ and ‘return’ (see Table 12.1). This produces a new knowledge space that renders suppliers’ financial conditions visible in order to identify cause-effect relations bearing on the chain’s efficiency and profitability (Edenius and Hasselbladh 2002: 249-57; Norreklit 2003: 601). Under constant pressure to review product categories, the identification of these cause-effect relations provides the everyday bases of calculation, intervention, hard-nosed negotiation and control. Mechanisms of control enable category managers to perform the following routine activities: (1) evaluating the change of each supplier’s costs and margins and requiring it to match its lowest price or even cut it; (2) comparing each supplier’s costs and margins with the average; (3) introducing a form of coordinated competition among suppliers (for example, asking specific suppliers to match lower prices of competing suppliers); (4) asking for alternatives based on a panoramic view of the suppliers’ costs and margins; and (5) clawing back funds (or in Wal-Mart’s term ‘payment from suppliers’) in the forms of ‘volume incentives, warehouse allowances, and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection and advertising’ (Wal-Mart 2007: 44). Seen through the micro accounting practice of scorecards, this ‘informationsharing’ in the supply chain also sustains a kind of organizational control based on informational ‘super-vision’. The visibility and benchmarking of suppliers enable Wal-Mart’s ‘category managers’ to demand lower prices, benchmark the average and demand refunds from suppliers. This way of disciplining suppliers can be seen, in neo-Foucauldian terms, as a virtual panopticon.2 Computerized corporate ‘wardens’ conduct organizational surveillance of suppliers who are also enrolled in their own disciplinary gaze. In short, the use of scorecards and similar micro accounting practices enable Wal-Mart to expropriate margins from suppliers (see below on the factory rating system as another example of organizational surveillance). This seemingly ‘managerial-logistical-information fix’ is not only techno-economic but also political. In the latter regard, it exhibits asymmetrical power relations that assist the transformation of capital-to-capital social relations, in particular by tilting the balance in favour of the retailers over the suppliers-manufacturers in the buyer-driven commodity chains (Gereffi and Korseniewicz 1994; French 2006). With this informational ‘super-vision’, Wal-Mart’s procurement staff members are constantly making deals with thousands of suppliers to produce goods tailored to Wal-Mart’s own stringent specifications, including pricing, quality assurance, sales, efficiency, delivery and, more recently, sustainability requirement. For many Wal-Mart suppliers entering the negotiations centre, the experience is a tough one. If their goods do not match Wal-Mart’s specified sales/price level, suppliers are immediately shown the door. In the negotiation centre, supply deals are made, terminated, ‘in a heartbeat’ (Bonacich and Wilson 2006: 239). This firm grip over suppliers-manufacturers and the unrelenting push for cost and price-value competitiveness means that manufacturers, in turn, must pass on their costs and production insecurity (for example, termination of orders) to their workers. Workers in Wal-Mart’s supplier factories, which the International Labour Rights Fund (ILRF) terms ‘Wal-Mart Sweatshops’, see their wages cut and safety and welfare measures ignored. This was evident in a report produced by Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM 2007), a Hong Kong-based NGO, which monitored Wal-Mart activities. This report identified extensive labour abuses (for example, wage and hour violations, unsafe working conditions, deprivation of labour contract protection) in five toy factories in China that manufactured for Wal-Mart. Similar problems were identified by the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) in its Cashing In report (2009a). The latter focused on the garment supply chains of the five big retailers (Wal-Mart, Tesco, Carrefour, Aldi and Lidl) and highlighted the poor conditions of their workers in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand. As for Wal-Mart’s own workers in their superstores, the familiar practice of Wal-Mart in the United States of paying a ‘minimized minimum wage’ (Lichtenstein 2006) also applied even more vigorously in developing countries. It pays the same low wage as other main retailers in developing countries but its workers receive even lower social benefits (Durand 2007). Indeed, while some local retailers try to prevent turnover by offering some social benefits, WalMart prefers to stabilize its workforce by selling shares to its employees (assuming they have money to buy them). © 2012 United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD).","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","978-113645936-8; 978-041559311-3","","","English","Bus.

The most common of these is iron deficiency; more than one-third of the world's population suffer from iron deficiency-induced anaemia, 80% of which are in developing countries. The consequences of iron deficiency include increased mortality and morbidity rates, diminished cognitive abilities in children and reduced labour productivity, which in turn stagnates national development. The developed world has made tremendous success in alleviating nutrient deficiencies through dietary diversification, food product fortification, improved public health care and supplementation. In developing countries, these strategies are often expensive and difficult to sustain, especially in rural areas. The rural poor typically consume what they grow and are dependent upon a small number of staple crops for the vast majority of their nutrition. Therefore, genetic improvement of staple crops (biofortification) is the most cost-effective and sustainable solution to this global health problem. In this study, we describe a strategy to enhance iron nutritional quality in maize using a human cell culture (Caco-2)-based bioassay as a phenotyping tool to guide genetic analysis of the trait. We also report validation of this approach using an animal feeding study. © 2011 NIAB.","biofortification; Caco-2 bioassay; iron nutrition; maize; quantitative trait loci","Animalia; Zea mays","O.A.

Worldwide efforts are focussing on this new topic in the environmental discussion: quantifying and valuation of impacts of agricultural practice on the animated and unanimated environment to draw conclusions for agricultural policy. A key function holds the term sustainability, which is assumed to dominate future policy approaches. The growing insecurity about the environmental impacts of agricultural land use systems led to the overall goal to avoid irreversible damages by agriculture. The development of tools for decision-makers on all decision levels are to: 1. recognise and value impacts degrading the environment; 2. assess future sources of danger; 3. develop sustainable land use systems. Decision supporting tools are worked out since few years for diverse purposes. As a term reflecting the most relevant environmental aspects on the global level agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) are in the focus of interest. Latest since the [Environmental Indicators for Agriculture, vol. 1: Concepts and Framework. Publications Service, OECD, Paris, 1997] launched the driving force-state-response (DSR) model and a catalogue with 14 AUI areas, which resulted from international discussions started on the Rio Conference in 1992, the political significance of an environmental measuring system was recognised. One of the focal points was the indicator issue concerning landscapes and to define indicators which are capable to describe landscapes. Actual indicator concepts for landscape of the OECD, the EU and the PAIS research project illustrate the efforts to integrate landscapes in agricultural policies. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although they may seem admirable, policies such as humanitarian and citizenship rights are really an imperial venture led by global institutions and corporations in order to export capitalist market forces worldwide. This entails a form of neoliberal citizenship in which social security is replaced by market insecurity and rising inequality. In this light, the citizen becomes an ""imperial subject"" whose needs and desires have been colonized by the global market. However, emerging social forces in Latin America and elsewhere have begun to challenge this imperialist logic, fostering a resistance that may bring forth a new global vision of citizenship. This unique analysis draws together neoliberal citizenship, new imperialism, and the creation of 'financial subjects' into an innovative theoretical exploration. By expanding the debate on global citizenship, Imperial Subjects will engage readers in political and social sciences interested in contemporary political thought, citizenship, and globalization. © Colin Mooers, 2014.

This study aims to identify and analyze the main food supply patterns (FSPs) of populations worldwide, and then to relate them to their respective malnutrition conditions. The hypothesis is that there are specific, geographically identifiable FSPs that are associated with the nutritional misalignment of certain populations to a greater degree than others. This investigation is based on data regarding the supply of the main food groups worldwide, as well as the metrics associated with malnutrition. Data analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, ANOVA, and correlation analysis. The results suggest the existence of nine clusters of countries with specific FSPs that differ significantly regarding their supplies of macronutrients and their malnutrition traits. Furthermore, using Pearson’s coefficient of variation (CV) to assess the balance level (or symmetry) of each FSP, reflecting the average supply of food groups, the results suggest the existence of a positive and significant correlation (r = 0.6364; p = 0.000) between the imbalance level of particular FSPs and the prevalence of underweight children in their respective populations. Also, FSPs 1, 3, and 4 are strongly associated with obesogenic traits, with FSP 3 being the most strongly associated with the prevalence of overweight. According to our analyses, the FSPs of Southern Africa (with a strong prevalence of child overweight) and Southern Asia (with a strong prevalence of child underweight) lead to the worst conditions observed, while the populations with the best nutritional status are based on the FSP of Eastern Asia. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Dietary models; Food security; Malnutrition; Nutritional composition; Obesogenic environment; World development","","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers","18764517","","","","English","Food Secur.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925490323"

We investigate its inherent insecurity as a payment solution and show how existing systems can be used for fraud or to deceive users. From a UK perspective, we see how the standardisation of mobile platforms with J2ME combined with WAP delivery have enabled the rise of the mobile content industry, with premium SMS as the most method common of billing. Threats to the established business models are addressed, with particular attention paid to the potential for severe disruption from mobile (SMS) spam.

Labour Office ILO, Geneva, Switzerland","Taran P.A., Intnl. Labour Office ILO, Geneva, Switzerland","This review summarizes main trends, issues, debates, actors and initiatives regarding recognition and extension of protection of the human rights of migrants. Its premise is that the rule of law and universal notions of human rights are essential foundations for democratic society and social peace. Evidence demonstrates that violations of migrants' human rights are so widespread and commonplace that they are a defining feature of international migration today. About 150 million persons live outside their countries; in many States, legal application of human rights norms to non-citizens is inadequate or seriously deficient, especially regarding irregular migrants. Extensive hostility against, abuse of and violence towards migrants and other non-nationals has become much more visible worldwide in recent years. Research, documentation and analysis of the character and extent of problems and of effective remedies remain minimal. Resistance to recognition of migrants' rights is bound up in exploitation of migrants in marginal, low status, inadequately regulated or illegal sectors of economic activity. Unauthorized migrants are often treated as a reserve of flexible labour, outside the protection of labour safety, health, minimum wage and other standards, and easily deportable. Evidence on globalization points to worsening migration pressures in many parts of the world. Processes integral to globalization have intensified disruptive effects of modernization and capitalist development, contributing to economic insecurity and displacement for many. Extension of principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights culminated in the 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. With little attention, progress in ratifications was very slow until two years ago. A global campaign revived attention; entry into force is likely in 2001. Comparative analysis notes that ILO migrant worker Conventions have generally achieved objectives but States have resisted adoption of any standards on treatment of non-nationals. A counter-offensive against human rights as universal, indivisible and inalienable underlies resistance to extension of human rights protection to migrants. A parallel trend is deliberate association of migration and migrants with criminality. Trafficking has emerged as a global theme contextualizing migration in a framework of combatting organized crime and criminality, subordinating human rights protections to control and anti-crime measures. Intergovernmental cooperation on migration ""management"" is expanding rapidly, with functioning regional intergovernmental consultative processes in all regions, generally focused on strengthening inter-state cooperation in controlling and preventing irregular migration through improved border controls, information sharing, return agreements and other measures. Efforts to defend human rights of migrants and combat xenophobia remain fragmented, limited in impact and starved of resources. Nonetheless, NGOs in all regions provide orientation, services and assistance to migrants, public education and advocating respect for migrants rights and dignity. Several international initiatives now highlight migrant protection concerns, notably the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights of Migrants, the Global Campaign promoting the 1990 UN Convention, UN General Assembly proclamation of International Migrants Day, the 2001 World Conference Against Racism and Xenophobia, anti-discrimination activity by ILO, and training by IOM. Suggestions to governments emphasize the need to define comprehensive, coordinated migration policy and practice based on economic, social and development concerns rather than reactive control measures to ensure beneficial migration, social harmony, and dignified treatment of nationals and non-nationals. NGOs, businesses, trade unions, and religious groups are urged to advocate respect for international standards, professionalize services and capacities, take leadership in opposing xenophobic behaviour, and join international initiatives. Need for increased attention to migrants rights initiatives and inter-agency cooperation by international organizations is also noted.","","human rights; immigrant population; policy making; strategic approach","","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","00207985","","","","English","Int.

However, obtaining such knowledge is hampered by the complex effects of climate alterations on the behavior of diverse types of vectors and the ease by which previously unknown viruses can emerge. A review written in 2011 provided a comprehensive analysis of available data on the effects of climate change on virus disease epidemics worldwide. This review summarizes its findings and those of two earlier climate change reviews and focuses on describing research published on the subject since 2011. It describes the likely effects of the full range of direct and indirect climate change parameters on hosts, viruses and vectors, virus control prospects, and the many information gaps and deficiencies. Recently, there has been encouraging progress in understanding the likely effects of some climate change parameters, especially over the effects of elevated CO2, temperature, and rainfall-related parameters, upon a small number of important plant viruses and several key insect vectors, especially aphids. However, much more research needs to be done to prepare for an era of (i) increasingly severe virus epidemics and (ii) increasing difficulties in controlling them, so as to mitigate their detrimental effects on future global food security and plant biodiversity. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Agriculture; Climate change; Climate instability; Control measures; Crop losses; Extreme weather events; Food insecurity; Future prospects; Global warming; Natural ecosystems; New technologies; Plant biodiversity; Plant virus epidemics; Research requirements; Virus vectors","Animals; Aphids; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Food Supply; Greenhouse Effect; Insect Vectors; Models, Statistical; Plant Diseases; Plant Viruses; Plant Weeds; Plants; carbon dioxide; animal; aphid; catering service; chemistry; climate; climate change; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; insect vector; pathogenicity; physiology; plant; plant disease; plant virus; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; virology; weed","R.A.C.

In Malaysia, poor dietary intake, overweight and obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolaemia have been reported to be more prevalent in females compared to males and in Indians compared to other ethnic groups. A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the relationship between food insecurity and health and nutritional status among 169 Indian women (19-49 years old, non-pregnant, and non-lactating) from randomly-selected palm-plantation households in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Subjects were interviewed for socioeconomic and demographic data, and information on household food security and dietary intake. They were examined for weight, height, waist-circumference, blood pressure and lipids, and plasma glucose levels. For analysis of data, descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and logistic regression were used. Majority (85.2%) of the households showed food insecurity as assessed using the Radimer/Cornell Hunger and Food Insecurity Instrument. The food-secure women had significantly higher mean years of education and lower mean number of children than food-insecure groups (p<0.05). There was a significant decrease in the mean household income and income per capita as food insecurity worsened (p<0.05). Women who reported food security had significantly higher mean diet diversity score (11.60±4.13) than child hunger (9.23±3.36). The group of subjects with higher intake of meat/fish/poultry/legumes (crude odds ratio [OR]=0.53, confidence interval [CI]=0.29-0.95) and higher diet diversity score (crude OR=0.87, 0=0.78-0.97) was more likely to have <3 health risks. Diet diversity score remained a significant protective factor against heath risks even after adjusting for other variables. The present study showed that food insecurity is indirectly associated with poor health and nutritional status. Therefore, appropriate communitybased interventions should be designed and implemented to address the problems of food insecurity and possible health and nutritional outcomes. ©INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR DIARRHOEAL DISEASE RESEARCH, BANGLADESH.","Diet diversity; Food insecurity; Health risks; Malaysia; Nutritional status","","M.

Currently, conclusions about bases for adjustment problems are qualified by limited longitudinal research from a process-oriented, social-ecological perspective. In this study, we examined a theoretically-based model for the impact of multiple levels of the social ecology (family, community) on adolescent delinquency. Specifically, this study explored the impact of children's emotional insecurity about both the family and community on youth delinquency in Northern Ireland. Methods In the context of a five-wave longitudinal research design, participants included 999 mother-child dyads in Belfast (482 boys, 517 girls), drawn from socially-deprived, ethnically-homogenous areas that had experienced political violence. Youth ranged in age from 10 to 20 and were 12.18 (SD = 1.82) years old on average at Time 1. Findings The longitudinal analyses were conducted in hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), allowing for the modeling of interindividual differences in intraindividual change. Intraindividual trajectories of emotional insecurity about the family related to children's delinquency. Greater insecurity about the community worsened the impact of family conflict on youth's insecurity about the family, consistent with the notion that youth's insecurity about the community sensitizes them to exposure to family conflict in the home. Conclusions The results suggest that ameliorating children's insecurity about family and community in contexts of political violence is an important goal toward improving adolescents' well-being, including reduced risk for delinquency. © 2015 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","community; delinquency; emotional security; family; mental health; Political violence; social ecology","adolescent; adult; child; delinquency; ecology; exposure; family; family conflict; family study; female; girl; human; juvenile; major clinical study; male; model; statistical model; theoretical model; United Kingdom; violence; wellbeing","E.M.

The first section provides the background for our analysis of global poverty and inequality. We demonstrate how different perspectives of development and the causes of poverty have implications for how one responds to poverty and inequality. The second section examines three key contemporary initiatives for global development. The final section focuses on the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) initiative. Through an analysis of the MDGs we reconnect to the key points put forward in the first section of this chapter. Background to poverty and inequality Global poverty and inequality are high on the agenda in world politics at the start of the new millennium. At the same time, the capacity of developed countries to eradicate poverty and address inequality has probably never been better. However, contemporary research continues to make clear that there is not only a growing gap worldwide between the rich and the poor, but also that there has been an unprecedented rise in insecurity and vulnerability in the everyday lived experiences of many people, specifically the poor. There is no shortage of figures and statistical evidence to draw upon in order to substantiate these claims (see for example, the World Bank's World Development reports since 1990 and the United Nations' Human Development reports). Activists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), policy-makers, politicians and scholars are all engaged in rigorous debates about the scale and character of global poverty and inequality. © Richard Devetak, Anthony Burke, Jim George 2007.","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","978-113916855-7; 978-052168276-3","","","English","An Introduction to International Relations: Australian Perspectives","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923488076"

Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV treatment has dramatically increased in resource-limited settings in recent years and allows more HIV-infected children to survive into adolescence and adulthood. Purpose: Our objective was to improve the understandability of pediatric antiretroviral adherence measurement items for use in resource-limited settings through cognitive interviewingwith pediatric caregivers and HIV-infected adolescents in Kenya. Methods: We compiled adherence measurement items through a systematic literature review and qualitative work. We conducted cognitive interviews assessing the items with caregivers of HIV-infected children enrolled in HIV care in Kenya and conducted group cognitive assessments with HIV-infected adolescents. We used verbal probing and guided ""thinking aloud"" to evaluate relevance, comprehension, recall, and sensitivity/acceptability. Analysis followed a systematic sequence of review, compiling data by item, and coding responses. Results: We interviewed 21Kenyan parents and guardians and 10 adolescents (mean age 15 years, SD 1.8) on antiretroviral therapy for a mean of 3.6 years. Cognitive interviews optimized item-response options, wording, and content. Some participants demonstrated difficulty with ""think aloud"" processes, but verbal probes were easily answered. Comprehension problems were found for key language concepts such ""missed doses"" and ""having side effects."" Key findings for response options included differences among responses to various recall periods, with preferences for the shortest (one 24-hday) and longest recall periods (1 month); difficulty describing specific drug information; benefits for including normalizing statements before asking for sensitive information; and challenges processing categorical frequency scales. Important content areas for inclusion included dose timing, disclosure, stigma, and food insecurity. Conclusions: Cognitive interviewing is a productive strategy for increasing the face validity and understandability of adherencemeasurement items, particularly across cultures. Interviews in Kenya suggested adherence measurement modifications of relevance for other resource-limited settings. © International Society of Behavioral Medicine 2012.","Adherence; Cognitive interviewing; HIV; Measurement; Resource-limited setting","Adolescent; Africa South of the Sahara; Anti-HIV Agents; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Comprehension; Cultural Characteristics; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Kenya; Language; Male; Medication Adherence; Parents; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adolescent; Africa south of the Sahara; article; caregiver; child; cognition; comprehension; cultural factor; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Kenya; language; male; medication compliance; methodology; parent; preschool child; psychologic test; psychological aspect; qualitative research; questionnaire; statistics","R.C.
