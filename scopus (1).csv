Objective: To construct, evaluate, and interpret a series of machine learning models to predict outcomes related to inpatient health care resource utilization for patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Summary of Background Data: Reducing postoperative health care utilization is an important goal for improving the delivery of surgical care and serves as a metric for quality assessment. Recent data has shown marked hospital resource utilization after ACDF surgery, including readmissions, and ED visits. The burden of postoperative health care use presents a potential application of machine learning techniques, which may be capable of accurately identifying at-risk patients using patient-specific predictors. Methods: Patients 18-88 years old who underwent ACDF from 2011 to 2021 at a multisite academic center and had preoperative lab values within 3 months of surgery were included. Outcomes analyzed included 90-day readmissions, postoperative length of stay, and nonhome discharge. Four machine learning models - Extreme Gradient Boosted Trees, Balanced Random Forest, Elastic-Net Penalized Logistic Regression, and a Neural Network - were trained and evaluated through the Area Under the Curve estimates. Feature importance scores were computed for the highest-performing model per outcome through model-specific metrics. Results: A total of 1026 cases were included in the analysis cohort. All machine learning models were predictive for outcomes of interest, with the Random Forest algorithm consistently demonstrating the strongest average area under the curve performance, with a peak performance of 0.84 for nonhome discharge. Important features varied per outcome, though age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification >2, and medical comorbidities were highly weighted in the studied outcomes. Conclusions: Machine learning models were successfully applied and predictive of postoperative health utilization after ACDF. Deployment of these tools can assist clinicians in determining high-risk patients. Level of Evidence: III. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

There is great promise in use of machine learning (ML) for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various medical conditions in ophthalmology and beyond. Applications of ML for ocular neoplasms are in early development and this review synthesizes the current state of ML in ocular oncology. METHODS. We queried PubMed and Web of Science and evaluated 804 publications, excluding nonhuman studies. Metrics on ML algorithm performance were collected and the Prediction model study Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool was used to evaluate bias. We report the results of 63 unique studies. RESULTS. Research regarding ML applications to intraocular cancers has leveraged multiple algorithms and data sources. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were one of the most commonly used ML algorithms and most work has focused on uveal melanoma and retinoblastoma. The majority of ML models discussed here were developed for diagnosis and prognosis. Algorithms for diagnosis primarily leveraged imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography) as inputs, whereas those for prognosis leveraged combinations of gene expression, tumor characteristics, and patient demographics. CONCLUSIONS. ML has the potential to improve the management of intraocular cancers. Published ML models perform well, but were occasionally limited by small sample sizes owing to the low prevalence of intraocular cancers. This could be overcome with synthetic data enhancement and low-shot ML techniques. CNNs can be integrated into existing diagnostic workflows, while non-neural networks perform well in determining prognosis.  © 2023 The Authors.","artificial intelligence; machine learning; ocular oncology; retinoblastoma; uveal melanoma","Algorithms; Humans; Machine Learning; Melanoma; Neural Networks, Computer; Retinal Neoplasms; biological marker; heat shock protein 27; osteopontin; amblyopia; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; cancer prognosis; cataract; cell microarray; choroid melanoma; convolutional neural network; decision tree; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic accuracy; differential gene expression; genetic analysis; human; hypermetropia; intraocular cancer; intraocular pressure; learning algorithm; machine learning; melanoma; neurofibrillary tangle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; optical coherence tomography; overall survival; predictive value; prevalence; progression free survival; receiver operating characteristic; retinoblastoma; Review; RNA sequencing; support vector machine; T1 weighted imaging; T2 weighted imaging; tumor volume; uvea melanoma; algorithm; machine learning; melanoma; pathology; retina tumor","A.S.

To provide patients with prompt, high-quality care, medical device manufacturing has grown at an unprecedented rate. Hospitals should use the best maintenance techniques to increase the life of their equipment while trying to reduce maintenance costs and efforts as medical device usage increases. This paper proposes a predictive maintenance method (PdM) to assist in identifying critical equipment failures with diverse and frequent failure modes. The proposed method is based on the understanding of the physics of the incident, real-time data collection of relevant parameters using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and application of machine learning algorithms to predict and classify the condition of the device as good and bad. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of moving from traditional maintenance to PdM, an economic analysis should be provided.

Artificial intelligence technology has been identified as a potential solution to accurately predict obesity rates and provide personalized feedback to adolescents. This study highlights the importance of early identification and prevention of obesity-related health issues. To develop effective algorithms for the prediction of obesity rates and provide personalized feedback, factors such as height, weight, waist circumference, calorie intake, physical activity levels, and other relevant health information must be taken into account. Therefore, by collecting health datasets from 321 adolescents who participated in Would You Do It! application, we proposed an adolescent obesity prediction system that provides personalized predictions and assists individuals in making informed health decisions. Our proposed deep learning framework, DeepHealthNet, effectively trains the model using data augmentation techniques, even when daily health data are limited, resulting in improved prediction accuracy (acc: 0.8842). Additionally, the study revealed variations in the prediction of the obesity rate between boys (acc: 0.9320) and girls (acc: 0.9163), allowing the identification of disparities and the determination of the optimal time to provide feedback. Statistical analysis revealed that the performance of the proposed deep learning framework was more statistically significant (p< 0.001) compared to the other general models. The proposed system has the potential to effectively address childhood and adolescent obesity.  © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Childhood obesity prediction; daily health informatics; deep learning; digital healthcare","Deep learning; E-learning; Health risks; Medical informatics; Nutrition; Wearable technology; Childhood obesity predictions; Daily health informatic; Deep learning; Digital healthcare; Health informatics; Learning frameworks; Obesity; Particle measurement; Predictive models; Wearable health-monitoring systems; adolescent obesity; anthropometry; Article; artificial intelligence; body height; body mass; caloric intake; child; data processing; deep learning; discriminant analysis; female; learning algorithm; long short term memory network; long term memory; male; maximum likelihood method; measurement precision; physical activity; prevalence; short term memory; sleep time; support vector machine; waist circumference; Forecasting","E.

Traditional image analysis relies on visual interpretation by a trained radiologist, which is time-consuming and can, to some degree, be subjective. The development of reliable, automated diagnostic tools is a key goal of radiomics, a fast-growing research field which combines medical imaging with personalized medicine. Radiomic studies have demonstrated potential for accurate lung cancer diagnoses and prognostications. The practice of delineating the tumor region of interest, known as segmentation, is a key bottleneck in the development of generalized classification models. In this study, the incremental multiple resolution residual network (iMRRN), a publicly available and trained deep learning segmentation model, was applied to automatically segment CT images collected from 355 lung cancer patients included in the dataset “Lung-PET-CT-Dx”, obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), an open-access source for radiological images. We report a failure rate of 4.35% when using the iMRRN to segment tumor lesions within plain CT images in the lung cancer CT dataset. Seven classification algorithms were trained on the extracted radiomic features and tested for their ability to classify different lung cancer subtypes. Over-sampling was used to handle unbalanced data. Chi-square tests revealed the higher order texture features to be the most predictive when classifying lung cancers by subtype. The support vector machine showed the highest accuracy, 92.7% (0.97 AUC), when classifying three histological subtypes of lung cancer: adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The results demonstrate the potential of AI-based computer-aided diagnostic tools to automatically diagnose subtypes of lung cancer by coupling deep learning image segmentation with supervised classification. Our study demonstrated the integrated application of existing AI techniques in the non-invasive and effective diagnosis of lung cancer subtypes, and also shed light on several practical issues concerning the application of AI in biomedicine. © 2023 by the authors.","classification; CT tumor segmentation; deep learning; lung cancer; radiomics","","Q.

We herein describe a study design protocol for recognizing neuropsychiatric complications associated with pediatric COVID-19, and for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies grounded on the evidence-based findings. Methods: The study includes two cohorts, each with 163 participants, aged from 7 to 18 years old, and matched by gender. One cohort consisted of individuals with a history of COVID-19, while the other group presents those without such a history. We undertake comprehensive assessments, including neuropsychiatric evaluations, blood tests, and validated questionnaires completed by parents/guardians and by the children themselves. The data analysis is based on machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for COVID-19-associated neuropsychiatric complications in children and adolescents. Results: The first model is focused on a binary classification to distinguish participants with and without a history of COVID-19. The second model clusters significant indicators of clinical dynamics during the follow-up observation period, including the persistence of COVID-19 related somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms over time. The third model manages the predictors of discrete trajectories in the dynamics of post-COVID-19 states, tailored for personalized prediction modeling of affective, behavioral, cognitive, disturbances (academic/school performance), and somatic symptoms of the long COVID. Conclusions: The current protocol outlines a comprehensive study design aiming to bring a better understanding of COVID-19associated neuropsychiatric complications in a population of children and adolescents, and to create a mobile phone-based applications for the diagnosis and treatment of affective, cognitive, and behavioral conditions. The study will inform about the improved management of preventive and personalized care strategies for pediatric COVID-19 patients.

We prospectively identified participants with lower extremity fractures at a tertiary academic center. These participants underwent gait analysis with a chest-mounted inertial measurement unit device. Using customized software, the raw gait data were preprocessed, emphasizing 12 essential gait variables. The data were standardized, and several machine learning models, including XGBoost, logistic regression, support vector machine, LightGBM, and Random Forest, were trained, tested, and evaluated. Special attention was given to class imbalance, addressed using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Additionally, we introduced a novel methodology to compute the post-injury recovery rate for gait variables, which operates independently of the time difference between the gait analyses of different participants. XGBoost was identified as the optimal model both before and after the application of SMOTE. Before using SMOTE, the model achieved an average test area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.90, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [0.79, 1.00], and an average test accuracy of 86%, with a 95% CI of [75%, 97%]. Through feature importance analysis, a pivotal role was attributed to the duration between the occurrence of the injury and the initial gait analysis. Data patterns over time revealed early aggressive physiological compensations, followed by stabilization phases, underscoring the importance of prompt gait analysis. χ2 analysis indicated a statistically significant higher readmission rate among participants with underlying medical conditions (p = 0.04). Although the complication rate was also higher in this group, the association did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06), suggesting a more pronounced impact of medical conditions on readmission rates rather than on complications. This study highlights the transformative potential of integrating advanced machine learning techniques like XGBoost with gait analysis for orthopedic care. The findings underscore a shift toward a data-informed, proactive approach in orthopedics, enhancing patient outcomes through early detection and intervention. The χ2 analysis added crucial insights into the broader clinical implications, advocating for a comprehensive treatment strategy that accounts for the patient's overall health profile. The research paves the way for personalized, predictive medical care in orthopedics, emphasizing the importance of timely and tailored patient assessments. © 2024 Orthopaedic Research Society.","data analysis; gait variables; lower extremity fractures; machine learning; recovery trajectory","","M.

This paper proposes a new protocol for privacy-preserving Naive Bayes classification using secure two-party computation (STPC). The key idea is to split the training data between two non-colluding servers using STPC to train the model without leaking information. The servers secretly share their data and the intermediate computations using cryptographic techniques like Beaver’s multiplication triples and Yao’s garbled circuits. We implement and evaluate our protocols on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that they achieve the same accuracy as plaintext computation with reasonable overhead. A formal security analysis in the semi-honest model shows that the scheme protects the privacy of the training data. Our work advances privacy-preserving machine learning by enabling secure outsourced Naive Bayes classification with applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and predictive analytics on confidential data from multiple entities. The modular design allows embedding different secure matrix multiplication techniques, making the framework adaptable. This line of research paves the way for practical and secure data mining in a distributed manner, upholding stringent privacy regulations. © 2023 the Author(s).","multiplication triple; Naive Bayes classification; secure two-party computation","","C.

We take a look at the influence that genetic variants have on illness manifestation and how typical one-size-fits-all treatments fall short. Data-driven insights, risk classification, and prognostic powers are just a few of the ways in which predictive analytics is ready to transform the industry. Together with artificial intelligence (AI), which can mimic human intellect, they hold the possibility of customizing treatment strategies with unparalleled accuracy. In this article, we'll go over the value of genetic profiling and how it's being used in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to forecast things like illness susceptibility and response to therapy. The moral and legal implications of using AI in medicine are also discussed. The confidence and privacy of our patients are protected by our emphasis on ethical procedures and data protection. Predictive analytics and artificial intelligence have already started to improve the treatment of hereditary heart disorders, as evidenced by case studies and success stories. The applications are as varied as the genetic differences themselves, ranging from early illness prediction to individualized pharmaceutical regimes and surgical procedures. Predictive analytics and artificial intelligence are merging to change how we think about inherited heart problems. Readers will walk away from this piece with a solid grasp of how predictive analytics and AI might influence the future of individualized treatment strategies for those with hereditary heart disorders. All people who are afflicted with these diseases have reason to hope that this path will lead to healthier hearts, happier lives, and a better future.  © 2023 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Cardiovascular Health; Data Analysis; Genetic Heart Diseases; Machine Learning; Patient Care; Personalized Medicine; Predictive Analytics; Risk Stratification; Treatment Optimization","Abstracting; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Heart; Learning algorithms; Patient treatment; Predictive analytics; Risk assessment; Cardiovascular health; Condition; Genetic heart disease; Heart disease; Machine-learning; Patient care; Personalized medicines; Risk stratification; Treatment optimization; Treatment plans; Machine learning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835034327-4","","","English","IEEE Int.

Due to this, traditional data analysis for extracting helpful information for any disease has become inefficient in providing accurate real-time valid information. Traditional data mining and statistical learning techniques, which lack sufficient domain knowledge on a complicatedly colossal amount of data, need to stop adopting new advances in deep learning technologies. Thus, the use of sophisticated machines with in-depth understanding and analysis capability is vital to provide real-time information in detecting and diagnosing diseases in the healthcare system. In this paper, we study recent deep learning approaches which are capable of working on high-dimensional and multi-dimensional data. These approaches have been deployed to identify the root cause of various diseases like Cancer, Lung Diseases, Heart Diseases, Diabetes, Hepatitis, Alzheimer’s, Dengue, Parkinson’s, etc. In this study, our key contributions are: 1. A decent overview of the deep learning techniques. 2. Several modalities in the diagnosis of various diseases. 3. Set out recent trends in various applications of deep learning in healthcare, some of which are analysis and diagnosis of medical images, precision medicine, drug discovery, predictive analysis to support clinical decisions, and sustainable public health. 4. Several deep learning approaches with their performance are described in detail. 5.

Pathology determines the causes behind the disease and identifies its development mechanism and functional consequences. Each disease has different identification methods, including X-ray scans for pneumonia, covid-19, and lung cancer, whereas biopsy and CT-scan can identify the presence of skin cancer and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Early disease detection leads to effective treatment and avoids abiding complications. Deep learning has provided a vast number of applications in medical sectors resulting in accurate and reliable early disease predictions. These models are utilized in the healthcare industry to provide supplementary assistance to doctors in identifying the presence of diseases. Majorly, these models are trained through secondary data sources since healthcare institutions refrain from sharing patients' private data to ensure confidentiality, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning models due to the requirement of extensive datasets for training to achieve optimal results. Federated learning deals with the data in such a way that it doesn't exploit the privacy of a patient's data. In this work, a wide variety of disease detection models trained through federated learning have been rigorously reviewed. This meta-analysis provides an in-depth review of the federated learning architectures, federated learning types, hyperparameters, dataset utilization details, aggregation techniques, performance measures, and augmentation methods applied in the existing models during the development phase. The review also highlights various open challenges associated with the disease detection models trained through federated learning for future research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer detection; Covid-19 prediction; Deep learning; Disease detection; Federated learning; Machine learning; Multi-disease classification; Pneumonia detection","Alzheimer Disease; Biopsy; COVID-19; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Physicians; Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Learning systems; Neurodegenerative diseases; Cancer detection; Covid-19 prediction; Deep learning; Detection models; Disease classification; Disease detection; Federated learning; Machine-learning; Multi-disease classification; Pneumonia detection; bacterial pneumonia; benign neoplasm; breast cancer; breast density; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer survival; cardiovascular disease; child; clinical effectiveness; comparative study; confidentiality; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; data privacy; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; digital imaging and communications in medicine; disease classification; electrocardiogram; federated learning; health care; health care cost; health care industry; heart disease; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; image analysis; information security; larynx cancer; latent period; lung disease; lung nodule; machine learning; malignant neoplasm; mammography; mathematical analysis; meta analysis; outcome assessment; Parkinson disease; pneumonia; predictive model; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; privacy; proportional hazards model; prostate cancer; recall; Review; skin cancer; skin defect; survival rate; thorax radiography; thyroid disease; transfer of learning; tumor associated leukocyte; x-ray computed tomography; Alzheimer disease; biopsy; coronavirus disease 2019; lung tumor; physician; Health care","K.

The vast majority of applications for machine learning and precision medicine also require data, which the systems then learn using supervision. Artificial neural network (ANN) technologies have been successfully used in medical research for several decades. They are commonly used to classify data to determine the likelihood of a patient developing a particular disease.

This study aims to evaluate the application value of an improved CT index combined with serum biomarkers, obtained through an artificial intelligence recognition system analyzing CT features of pulmonary nodules, in early prediction of lung cancer infiltration using machine learning models. Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data of 803 patients hospitalized for lung cancer treatment from January 2020 to December 2023 at two hospitals: Hospital 1 (Affiliated Changshu Hospital of Soochow University) and Hospital 2 (Nantong Eighth People’s Hospital). Data from Hospital 1 were used for internal training, while data from Hospital 2 were used for external validation. Five algorithms, including traditional logistic regression (LR) and machine learning techniques (generalized linear models [GLM], random forest [RF], gradient boosting machine [GBM], deep neural network [DL], and naive Bayes [NB]), were employed to construct models predicting early lung cancer infiltration and were analyzed. The models were comprehensively evaluated through receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis based on LR, calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), as well as global and individual interpretative analyses using variable feature importance and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP) plots. Results: A total of 560 patients were used for model development in the training dataset, while a dataset comprising 243 patients was used for external validation. The GBM model exhibited the best performance among the five algorithms, with AUCs of 0.931 and 0.99 in the validation and test sets, respectively, and accuracies of 0.857 and 0.955 in the validation and test groups, respectively, outperforming other models. Additionally, the study found that nodule diameter and average CT value were the most significant features for predicting lung cancer infiltration using machine learning models. Conclusion: The GBM model established in this study can effectively predict the risk of infiltration in early-stage lung cancer patients, thereby improving the accuracy of lung cancer screening and facilitating timely intervention for infiltrative lung cancer patients by clinicians, leading to early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, and ultimately reducing lung cancer-related mortality.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is of two types: virtual and physical. The virtual part decides the treatment using electronic health record systems using various sensors whereas the physical part assists robots to perform surgeries, implants, replacement of various organs, elderly care, etc. Using AI, a machine can examine various kinds of health care test reports in one go which could save the time, money, and increase the chances of the patient to be treated without any hassles. At present, artificial intelligence (AI) is used while deciding the treatment, and medications using various tools which could analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and any other data. During the COVID pandemic, there was a huge/massive demand for AI-supported technologies and many of those were created during that time. This study is focused on various applications of AI in healthcare. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland 2023.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR); Computer vision; Deep learning; Machine learning; MYCIN","Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Humans; Machine Learning; artificial intelligence; decision making; dentistry; drug development; endoscopy; futurology; gene targeting; gene therapy; human; image analysis; legal liability; medicine; oncology; personalized medicine; postoperative period; predictive model; psychiatry; radiology; Review; robotics; treatment planning; coronavirus disease 2019; machine learning","R.

Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations were applied. Electronic databases Science Direct, MEDLINE through (PubMed, Google Scholar), EBSCO, ERIC, and CINAHL were searched for the period of January 2016 to September 2023. Using a pre-designed data extraction sheet, the review data were extracted. Big data, risk assessment, colorectal cancer, and artificial intelligence were the main terms. Results Fifteen studies were included. A total of 3,057,329 colo-rectal cancer (CRC) health records, including those of adult patients older than 18, were used to generate the results. The curve's area under the curve ranged from 0.704 to 0.976. Logistic regression, random forests, and colon flag were often employed techniques. Overall, these trials provide a considerable and accurate CRC risk prediction. Conclusion An up-to-date summary of recent research on the use of big data in CRC prediction was given. Future research can be facilitated by the review's identification of gaps in the literature. Missing data, a lack of external validation, and the diversity of machine learning algorithms are the current obstacles. Despite having a sound mathematical definition, area under the curve application depends on the modelling context. © 2024, Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton.

Although computers are believed to gain an important role in the assessment of medical images for breast evaluation for at least two decades, their impact on performance has not lived up to expectations yet. With the continuous and rapid development of computer science, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, like machine learning and deep learning, have been introduced for the analysis of medical images. Because of the remarkable advances in data extraction and analysis in medical imaging compared to conventional feature-based techniques, AI has reignited the interest in automated breast image interpretation. Extensive research is conducted on accurate detection and classification of breast lesions, and more specifically, the predictive and prognostic features of breast cancer by radiomics. Radiomics exploits the fact that image data is nowadays numerical and can also be used to generate quantitative biomarkers. In this comprehensive review, we cover the progress, application and challenge of radiomics and AI in breast cancer diagnosis in recent years, as well as the impact and significance of AI on future breast cancer research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Artificial Intelligence; Breast cancer; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mammography; Radiomics; Ultrasound","Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image analysis; Medical imaging; Ultrasonic applications; Breast Cancer; Breast images; Breast imaging; Data extraction and analysis; Feature-based techniques; Image interpretation; Machine-learning; Medical imaging techniques; Performance; Radiomic; Magnetic resonance imaging","T.

According to latest statistics, nearly five percent of the global population is suffering from spinal disorders. To relieve the pain, many spine patients tend to choose surgeries. However, recent evidences reveal that some spine patients can self-heal over time with nonoperative treatment and even surgeries may not ease the pain for some others, which raises a critical question regarding the appropriateness of such surgeries. Furthermore, the complex and time-consuming diagnostic process places a great burden on both clinicians and patients. Due to the development of web technology, it is possible for spine patients to obtain decision making suggestions on the Internet. The uniqueness of web technology, including its popularity, convenience, and immediacy, makes intelligent healthcare techniques, especially Treatment Outcome Forecasting (TOF), able to support clinical decision-making for doctors and healthcare providers. Despite a few machine-learning-based methods have been proposed for TOF, their performance and feasibility are mostly unsatisfactory due to the neglect of a few practical challenges (caused by applying on the Internet), including biased data selection, noisy supervision, and patient noncompliance. In light of this, we propose DeepTOF, a novel end-to-end deep learning model to cope with the unique challenges in web-based long-term continuous spine TOF. In particular, we combine different patient groups and train a unified predictive model to eliminate the data selection bias. Towards robust learning, we further take advantage of indirect but fine-grained supervision signals to mutually calibrate with the noisy training labels. Additionally, a feature selector was co-trained with DeepTOF to select the most important features (i.e., answers/indicators that need to be collected) for inference, thus easing the use of DeepTOF during web-based real-world application. The proposed DeepTOF could bring great benefits to the rehabilitation of spine patients. Comprehensive experiments and analysis show that DeepTOF outperforms conventional solutions by a large margin.  © 2023 ACM.","health informatics; intelligent healthcare; medical forecasting","Data reduction; Decision making; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Medical informatics; Patient rehabilitation; Population statistics; Surgery; Websites; Critical questions; Data Selection; Global population; Health informatics; Intelligent healthcare; Medical forecasting; Spinal disorders; Treatment outcomes; Web based; Web technologies; Forecasting","Y.

Predictive modelling using EHR data has been increasingly utilized in healthcare, achieving outstanding performance and improving healthcare outcomes. Objectives: The main goal of this review study is to examine different deep learning approaches and techniques used to EHR data processing. Methods: To find possibly pertinent articles that have used deep learning on EHR data, the PubMed database was searched. Using EHR data, we assessed and summarized deep learning performance in a number of clinical applications that focus on making specific predictions about clinical outcomes, and we compared the outcomes with those of conventional machine learning models. Results: For this study, a total of 57 papers were chosen. There have been five identified clinical outcome predictions: illness (n=33), intervention (n=6), mortality (n=5), Hospital readmission (n=7), and duration of stay (n=1). The majority of research (39 out of 57) used structured EHR data. RNNs were used as deep learning models the most frequently (LSTM: 17 studies, GRU: 6 research). The analysis shows that deep learning models have excelled when applied to a variety of clinical outcome predictions. While deep learning's application to EHR data has advanced rapidly, it's crucial that these models remain reliable, offering critical insights to assist clinicians in making informed decision. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that deep learning can outperform classic machine learning techniques since it has the advantage of utilizing extensive and sophisticated datasets, such as longitudinal data seen in EHR. We think that deep learning will keep expanding because it has been quite successful in enhancing healthcare outcomes utilizing EHR data. © 2023, Jacobs Verlag.

Early ASD identification is challenging and there is no treatment, early detection and intervention are vital for improving outcomes in individuals with ASD. This research, explored the application of machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB), for detection of ASD using a dataset focused on screening toddlers. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle in the 2018 release, encompasses demographic information, medical history, and screening test results for toddlers. The presented system employs leading edge algorithms to analyze the dataset and build predictive models for ASD detection. SVM is preferred due to its capability to lever multifaceted associations in high-dimensional data, while RF excels in handling diverse feature sets and capturing nonlinarites.GB, known for its ensemble learning capabilities, is also employed to boost predictive performance. The assessment of these models is accomplished via bench mark estimation metrics in ML. This approach aims at an effective model for ASD detection in children based on the characteristics of the dataset. Additionally, feature importance analysis is conducted to gain insights into the factors contributing to ASD prediction. The implementation results reveals that SVM algorithm outperforms in the proposed ASD diagnosis. Early identification using ML techniques could assist healthcare professionals and caretakers in timely intervention, ultimately improving the prolonged effects for persons with ASD. © 2024 IEEE.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); Behavioural Analysis; Hyperparameter Tuning; Machine Learning","Adaptive boosting; Clustering algorithms; Diagnosis; Diseases; Learning systems; Spectrum analysis; Statistical tests; Autism spectrum disorder; Autism spectrum disorders; Behavioral analysis; Gradient boosting; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter tuning; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Random forests; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","S.

This imaging examination method enables a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the metabolic changes before and after treatment, as well as the metabolic difference between lesions and blood pools. However, the heterogeneity of lymphoma, coupled with the limitations of 18F-FDG PET/CT in differentiation, poses challenges for physicians and adversely impacts the clinical treatment plan and prognosis of patients. With the advancement of computer hardware and image analysis technology, radiomics technology, based on the extraction of imaging features of lesions for analysis and diagnosis, has emerged. Numerous researchers have dedicated their efforts to exploring imageomics in lymphoma assessment by using 18F-FDG PET/CT. By integrating feature data with relevant clinical information, models have been developed to effectively correlate image information, clinical data, pathology, and survival outcomes, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of imaging diagnosis. Furthermore, the utilization of predictive models for prognosis and treatment efficacy has the potential to mitigate subjective errors arising from disparities in physician experience, thereby contributing to the realization of personalized medicine. This review intends to comprehensively summarize the research progress of 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics in the diagnosis, treatment and evaluation of lymphoma in recent years, from the aspects of diagnosis and differential diagnosis, prognosis prediction and risk grading, drug efficacy prediction and radiomics analysis algorithm optimization, so as to provide insights for future research in machine learning and the development of medical imaging analysis techniques. © 2023 Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Data were collected from the electronic records and the databases of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between 2004 and 2018. Participants 380 inpatients diagnosed with acute AD were included in the study. Primary outcome Preoperative in-hospital mortality rate. Results A total of 55 patients (14.47%) died in the hospital before surgery. The results of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves, decision curve analysis and calibration curves indicated that the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model had the highest accuracy and robustness. According to the SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis of the XGBoost model, Stanford type A, maximum aortic diameter >5.5 cm, high variability in HR, high variability in diastolic BP and involvement of the aortic arch had the greatest impact on the occurrence of in-hospital deaths before surgery. Moreover, the predictive model can accurately predict the preoperative in-hospital mortality rate at the individual level. Conclusion In the current study, we successfully constructed machine learning models to predict the preoperative in-hospital mortality of patients with acute AD, which can help identify high-risk patients and optimise the clinical decision-making. Further applications in clinical practice require the validation of these models using a large-sample, prospective database. Trial registration number ChiCTR1900025818. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

These respective models are investigated as mathematical objects or can be employed for describing a target system. As a long-Term aperiodic and random-like behavior manifested by many nonlinear complex dynamic systems, chaos induces that the system itself is inherently unstable and disordered, which requires the revealing of representative and accessible paths towards affluence of complexity and experimental processes so that novelty, diversity and robustness can be generated. Hence, complexity theory focuses on non-deterministic systems, whereas chaos theory rests on deterministic systems. These entailments demonstrate that chaos and complexity theory provide a synthesis of emerging wholes of individual components rather than the orientation of analyzing systems in isolation. Therefore, mathematical modeling and scientific computing are among the chief tools to solve the challenges and problems related to complex and chaotic systems through innovative ways ascribed to data science with a precisely tailored approach which can examine the data applied. The complexity definitions need to be weighed over different data offering a highly extensive applicability spectrum with more practicality and convenience owing to the fact that the respective processes lie in the concrete mathematical foundations, which all may as well indicate that the methods are required to be examined thoroughly regarding their mathematical foundation along with the related methods to be applied. Furthermore, making use of chaos theory can be considered to be a way to better understand the internal machinations of neural networks, and the amalgamation of chaos theory as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) can open up stimulating possibilities acting instrumental to tackle diverse challenges, with AI algorithms providing improvements in the predictive capabilities via the introduction of adaptability, enabling chaos theory to respond to even slight changes in the input data, which results in a higher level of predictive accuracy. Therefore, chaos-based algorithms are employed for the optimization of neural network architectures and training processes. Fractional mathematics, with the application of fractional calculus techniques geared towards the problems' solutions, describes the existence characteristics of complex natural, applied sciences, scientific, engineering related and medical systems more accurately to reflect the actual state properties co-evolving entities and patterns of the systems concerning nonlinear dynamic systems and modeling complexity evolution with fractional chaotic and complex systems. Complexity entails holistic understanding of various processes through multi-stage integrative models across spanning scales for expounding complex systems while following actuality across evolutionary path. Moreover, Fractional Calculus (FC), related to the dynamics of complicated real-world problems, ensures emerging processes adopting fractional dynamics rather than the ordinary integer-ordered ones, which means the related differential equations feature non-integer valued derivatives. Given that slight perturbation leads to a significantly divergent future concatenation of events, pinning down the state of different systems precisely can enable one to unveil uncertainty to some extent. Predicting the future evolution of chaotic systems can screen the direction towards distant horizons with extensive applications in order to understand the internal machinations of neural and chaotic complex systems. Even though many problems are solvable and have been solved, they remain to be open constantly under transient circumstances.

With greater access to a diverse range of big datasets, researchers are turning to these powerful techniques for data analysis. Machine learning can reveal patterns and interactions between variables in large and complex datasets more accurately and efficiently than traditional statistical methods. Machine learning approaches open new possibilities for studying SLE, a multifactorial, highly heterogeneous and complex disease. Here, we discuss how machine learning methods are rapidly being integrated into the field of SLE research. Recent reports have focused on building prediction models and/or identifying novel biomarkers using both supervised and unsupervised techniques for understanding disease pathogenesis, early diagnosis and prognosis of disease. In this review, we will provide an overview of machine learning techniques to discuss current gaps, challenges and opportunities for SLE studies. External validation of most prediction models is still needed before clinical adoption. Utilisation of deep learning models, access to alternative sources of health data and increased awareness of the ethics, governance and regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence in medicine will help propel this exciting field forward.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

The precise control over the temporary loss of consciousness is vital to ensure safe, pain-free procedures. Traditional methods of depth of anaesthesia (DoA) assessment, reliant on physical characteristics, have proven inconsistent due to individual variations. In response, electroencephalography (EEG) techniques have emerged, with indices such as the Bispectral Index offering quantifiable assessments. This literature review explores the current scope and frontier of DoA research, emphasising methods utilising EEG signals for effective clinical monitoring. This review offers a critical synthesis of recent advances, specifically focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) techniques and their role in enhancing clinical monitoring. By examining 117 high-impact papers, the review delves into the nuances of feature extraction, model building, and algorithm design in EEG-based DoA analysis. Comparative assessments of these studies highlight their methodological approaches and performance, including clinical correlations with established indices like the Bispectral Index. The review identifies knowledge gaps, particularly the need for improved collaboration for data access, which is essential for developing superior machine learning models and real-time predictive algorithms for patient management. It also calls for refined model evaluation processes to ensure robustness across diverse patient demographics and anaesthetic agents.

Much of the data from abdominal computed tomography images remain underused by radiologists. This study explores the application of machine learning in differentiating tumor tissue from healthy liver tissue using radiomics features. Preoperative contrast-enhanced images of 94 patients were used. A total of 1686 features classified as first-order, second-order, higher-order, and shape statistics were extracted from the regions of interest of each patient’s imaging data. Then, the variance threshold, the selection of statistically significant variables using the Student’s t-test, and lasso regression were used for feature selection. Six classifiers were used to identify tumor and non-tumor liver tissue, including random forest, support vector machines, naive Bayes, adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and logistic regression. Grid search was used as a hyperparameter tuning technique, and a 10-fold cross-validation procedure was applied. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) assessed the performance. The AUROC scores varied from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.), with naive Bayes achieving the best score. The radiomics features extracted were classified with a good score, and the radiomics signature enabled a prognostic biomarker for hepatic tumor screening. © 2024 by the authors.","classification; hepatocellular carcinoma; liver lesions; machine learning; metastasis; radiomic features","adult; Article; Bayesian learning; benign neoplasm; cancer classification; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer screening; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; cross validation; density gradient; diagnostic test accuracy study; electronic medical record; feature selection; female; human; human tissue; image analysis; image quality; image segmentation; learning algorithm; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; liver cancer; liver cell carcinoma; liver tissue; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; male; metastasis; middle aged; particle size; predictive value; quantitative analysis; radiologist; radiomics; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; Student t test; support vector machine; three-dimensional imaging","V.-B.S.

Its primary aim is the development of a non-invasive Nadi Pariksha system that can aid healthcare professionals in the identification of various medical conditions. This approach is designed to augment early disease detection and diagnosis, ultimately mitigating the mortality rates associated with delayed diagnoses. The system is primarily focused on the assessment of wrist pulses (Nadi) at three specific anatomical locations, denoted as 'vata,' 'pitta,' and 'kapha,' utilizing pulse sensors. These pulse readings are subjected to processing to extract crucial pulse characteristics such as shape, rate, and amplitude. Advanced signal processing methods, including amplification, filtering, and noise reduction, they are used to improve the quality of pulse data, ensuring the precision of measurements. A substantial dataset of human pulse samples is amassed, representing a diverse range of health conditions. This dataset serves as a critical component in training a machine learning model designed to discern patterns between pulse characteristics and various health conditions, thereby creating a predictive tool for disease diagnosis. The machine learning model undergoes rigorous training and evaluation, with the Random Forest algorithm emerging as the preferred choice due to its superior accuracy (86.4%) when compared to other models, such as XG Boost and Multi-SVM. Prior to real-world implementation, the system's accuracy and reliability necessitate thorough validation through clinical testing. Ethical considerations, encompassing patient privacy, data security, and informed consent, hold utmost significance to ensure the ethical application of this healthcare technology. The potential benefits of this system include early disease detection, reduced mortality rates, and regular monitoring of patients' health, making it a valuable tool in preventing delayed diagnoses.  © 2023 IEEE.","Accuracy; amplification; Diagnosis; Kapha; Machine Learning; ML; Nadi Pariksha; Non-Invasive; Pitta; Pulse; Random Forest; rf; Vata; VPK; XG Boost","Ethical technology; Forestry; Health care; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Population statistics; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Accuracy; Kapha; Machine-learning; ML; Nadi pariksha; Non-invasive; Pitta; Pulse; Random forests; Rf; Vata; VPK; XG boost; Diagnosis","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835039458-0","","","English","Intell.

Therefore, finding efficient methods to automate checking of water suitability is of great importance. In the context of this research work, we leveraged a supervised learning approach in order to design as accurate as possible predictive models from a labelled training dataset for the identification of water suitability, either for consumption or other uses. We assume a set of physiochemical and microbiological parameters as input features that help represent the water’s status and determine its suitability class (namely safe or nonsafe). From a methodological perspective, the problem is treated as a binary classification task, and the machine learning models’ performance (such as Naive Bayes–NB, Logistic Regression–LR, k Nearest Neighbours–kNN, tree-based classifiers and ensemble techniques) is evaluated with and without the application of class balancing (i.e., use or nonuse of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique–SMOTE), comparing them in terms of Accuracy, Recall, Precision and Area Under the Curve (AUC). In our demonstration, results show that the Stacking classification model after SMOTE with 10-fold cross-validation outperforms the others with an Accuracy and Recall of 98.1%, Precision of 100% and an AUC equal to 99.9%. In conclusion, in this article, a framework is presented that can support the researchers’ efforts toward water quality prediction using machine learning (ML). © 2023 by the authors.","classification; data analysis; environmental impact; machine learning; prediction; sustainability; water quality","","E.

These require fixed assay-specific thresholds and timepoints, without directly integrating clinical information. Using machine-learning techniques including hs-cTn and clinical routine variables, we aimed to build a digital tool to directly estimate the individual probability of MI, allowing for numerous hs-cTn assays. Methods: In 2,575 patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected MI, two ensembles of machine-learning models using single or serial concentrations of six different hs-cTn assays were derived to estimate the individual MI probability (ARTEMIS model). Discriminative performance of the models was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and logLoss. Model performance was validated in an external cohort with 1688 patients and tested for global generalizability in 13 international cohorts with 23,411 patients. Results: Eleven routinely available variables including age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, electrocardiography, and hs-cTn were included in the ARTEMIS models. In the validation and generalization cohorts, excellent discriminative performance was confirmed, superior to hs-cTn only. For the serial hs-cTn measurement model, AUC ranged from 0.92 to 0.98. Good calibration was observed. Using a single hs-cTn measurement, the ARTEMIS model allowed direct rule-out of MI with very high and similar safety but up to tripled efficiency compared to the guideline-recommended strategy. Conclusion: We developed and validated diagnostic models to accurately estimate the individual probability of MI, which allow for variable hs-cTn use and flexible timing of resampling. Their digital application may provide rapid, safe and efficient personalized patient care.

The algorithm was successfully tested in five international institutions using 1101 patients from different continents. The incorporation of 18 prognostic factors strengthens its predictive ability but limits its clinical utility because some prognostic factors might not be clinically available when a clinician wishes to make a prediction. Questions/purposes We performed this study to (1) evaluate the SORG-MLA’s performance with data and (2) develop an internet-based application to impute the missing data. Methods A total of 2768 patients were included in this study. The data of 617 patients who were treated surgically were intentionally erased, and the data of the other 2151 patients who were treated with radiotherapy and medical treatment were used to impute the artificially missing data. Compared with those who were treated nonsurgically, patients undergoing surgery were younger (median 59 years [IQR 51 to 67 years] versus median 62 years [IQR 53 to 71 years]) and had a higher proportion of patients with at least three spinal metastatic levels (77% [474 of 617] versus 72% [1547 of 2151]), more neurologic deficit (normal American Spinal Injury Association [E] 68% [301 of 443] versus 79% [1227 of 1561]), higher BMI (23 kg/m2 [IQR 20 to 25 kg/m2] versus 22 kg/m2 [IQR 20 to 25 kg/m2]), higher platelet count (240 3 103/mL [IQR 173 to 327 3 103/mL] versus 227 3 103/mL [IQR 165 to 302 3 103/mL], higher lymphocyte count (15 3 103/mL [IQR 9 to 213 103/mL] versus 14 3 103/mL [IQR 8 to 21 3 103/mL]), lower serum creatinine level (0.7 mg/dL [IQR 0.6 to 0.9 mg/dL] versus 0.8 mg/dL [IQR 0.6 to 1.0 mg/dL]), less previous systemic therapy (19% [115 of 617] versus 24% [526 of 2151]), fewer Charlson comorbidities other than cancer (28% [170 of 617] versus 36% [770 of 2151]), and longer median survival. The two patient groups did not differ in other regards. These findings aligned with our institutional philosophy of selecting patients for surgical intervention based on their level of favorable prognostic factors such as BMI or lymphocyte counts and lower levels of unfavorable prognostic factors such as white blood cell counts or serum creatinine level, as well as the degree of spinal instability and severity of neurologic deficits. This approach aims to identify patients with better survival outcomes and prioritize their surgical intervention accordingly. Seven factors (serum albumin and alkaline phosphatase levels, international normalized ratio, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, and the presence of visceral or brain metastases) were considered possible missing items based on five previous validation studies and clinical experience. Artificially missing data were imputed using the missForest imputation technique, which was previously applied and successfully tested to fit the SORG-MLA in validation studies. Discrimination, calibration, overall performance, and decision curve analysis were applied to evaluate the SORG-MLA’s performance. The discrimination ability was measured with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. It ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating the worst discrimination and 1.0 indicating perfect discrimination. An area under the curve of 0.7 is considered clinically acceptable discrimination. Calibration refers to the agreement between the predicted outcomes and actual outcomes. An ideal calibration model will yield predicted survival rates that are congruent with the observed survival rates. The Brier score measures the squared difference between the actual outcome and predicted probability, which captures calibration and discrimination ability simultaneously. A Brier score of 0 indicates perfect prediction, whereas a Brier score of 1 indicates the poorest prediction. A decision curve analysis was performed for the 6-week, 90-day, and 1-year prediction models to evaluate their net benefit across different threshold probabilities. Using the results from our analysis, we developed an internet-based application that facilitates real-time data imputation for clinical decision-making at the point of care. This tool allows healthcare professionals to efficiently and effectively address missing data, ensuring that patient care remains optimal at all times. Results Generally, the SORG-MLA demonstrated good discriminatory ability, with areas under the curve greater than 0.7 in most cases, and good overall performance, with up to 25% improvement in Brier scores in the presence of one to three missing items. The only exceptions were albumin level and lymphocyte count, because the SORG-MLA’s performance was reduced when these two items were missing, indicating that the SORG-MLA might be unreliable without these values. The model tended to underestimate the patient survival rate. As the number of missing items increased, the model’s discriminatory ability was progressively impaired, and a marked underestimation of patient survival rates was observed. Specifically, when three items were missing, the number of actual survivors was up to 1.3 times greater than the number of expected survivors, while only 10% discrepancy was observed when only one item was missing. When either two or three items were omitted, the decision curves exhibited substantial overlap, indicating a lack of consistent disparities in performance. This finding suggests that the SORG-MLA consistently generates accurate predictions, regardless of the two or three items that are omitted. We developed an internet application (https://sorg-spine-mets-missing-dataimputation.azurewebsites.net/) that allows the use of SORG-MLA with up to three missing items. Conclusion The SORG-MLA generally performed well in the presence of one to three missing items, except for serum albumin level and lymphocyte count (which are essential for adequate predictions, even using our modified version of the SORG-MLA). We recommend that future studies should develop prediction models that allow for their use when there are missing data, or provide a means to impute those missing data, because some data are not available at the time a clinical decision must be made. Clinical Relevance The results suggested the algorithm could be helpful when a radiologic evaluation owing to a lengthy waiting period cannot be performed in time, especially in situations when an early operation could be beneficial. It could help orthopaedic surgeons to decide whether to intervene palliatively or extensively, even when the surgical indication is clear.

These cutting-edge technologies are revolutionizing the landscape of cancer care, enhancing both precision and personalization in medical treatments. Our review provides an in-depth analysis of the latest advancements in AI and radiomics, with a specific focus on their roles in urological oncology. We discuss how AI and radiomics have notably improved the accuracy of diagnosis and staging in bladder cancer, especially through advanced imaging techniques like multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and CT scans. These tools are pivotal in assessing muscle invasiveness and pathological grades, critical elements in formulating treatment plans. In the realm of kidney cancer, AI and radiomics aid in distinguishing between renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes and grades. The integration of radiogenomics offers a comprehensive view of disease biology, leading to tailored therapeutic approaches. Prostate cancer diagnosis and management have also seen substantial benefits from these technologies. AI-enhanced MRI has significantly improved tumor detection and localization, thereby aiding in more effective treatment planning. The review also addresses the challenges in integrating AI and radiomics into clinical practice, such as the need for standardization, ensuring data quality, and overcoming the “black box” nature of AI. We emphasize the importance of multicentric collaborations and extensive studies to enhance the applicability and generalizability of these technologies in diverse clinical settings. In conclusion, AI and radiomics represent a major paradigm shift in oncology, offering more precise, personalized, and patient-centric approaches to cancer care. While their potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, patient outcomes, and our understanding of cancer biology is profound, challenges in clinical integration and application persist. We advocate for continued research and development in AI and radiomics, underscoring the need to address existing limitations to fully leverage their capabilities in the field of oncology. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; bladder cancer; diagnostic imaging; kidney cancer; oncology; personalized medicine; prostate cancer; radiomics; urological cancers","biological marker; platinum; apparent diffusion coefficient; area under the curve; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; bladder cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer grading; cancer research; clinical decision making; data quality; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; diffusion weighted imaging; digital rectal examination; Gleason score; human; machine learning; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; personalized medicine; predictive value; prospective study; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; radiomics; renal cell carcinoma; Review; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; three-dimensional imaging; transrectal ultrasonography; treatment outcome; treatment planning; tumor differentiation","L.

Biomedical devices and various hospital applications generate extensive clinical data, providing a rich resource for predictive analysis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly harnessed to forecast heart conditions, with Machine Learning (ML) emerging as a potent tool for informed decision-making and precise predictions. Significant strides are evident in the medical industry's adoption of machine learning techniques. This progress primarily hinges on training models with sample cases, utilizing data from clinical tests to predict ailments. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of heart disease-related data becomes imperative for enhancing prediction accuracy. A pivotal role is played by feature selection in this process, as it effectively eliminates redundant and irrelevant features, thereby reducing the training cost and time of predictive models. This article advocates for the usage of AI-based highlight determination methods in anticipating coronary illness. The proposed work introduces a disease prediction model employing various combinations of feature selection techniques. The efficacy of the prediction model is assessed using a dataset sourced from a heart disease database. The proposed strategies are assessed because of exactness, accuracy, review, and f1-score.

The strong and broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect of plasma-activated liquids (PALs) is now well known. The antimicrobial effects of PALs depend on many different variables, which complicates the comparison of different studies and determining the most dominant parameters for the antimicrobial effect. The proven applicability of machine learning (ML) in the medical field is encouraging for its application in the field of plasma medicine as well. Thus, ML applications on PALs could present a new perspective to better understand the influences of various parameters on their antimicrobial effects. In this paper, comparative supervised ML models are presented by using previously obtained data to predict the in vitro antimicrobial activity of PALs. A comprehensive literature search was performed, and 12 distinct features related to PAL-microorganism interactions were collected from 33 relevant articles to automatically predict the antimicrobial activity of PALs. After the required normalization, feature encoding, and resampling steps, two supervised ML methods, namely classification and regression, are applied to the data to obtain microbial inactivation (MI) predictions. For classification, MI is labeled in four categories, and for regression, MI is used as a continuous variable. Sixteen different classifiers and 14 regressors are implemented to predict the MI value. Two different robust cross-validation strategies are conducted for classification and regression models to evaluate the proposed method: repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation, respectively. We also investigate the effect of different features on models. The results demonstrated that the hyperparameter-optimized Random Forest Classifier (oRFC) and Random Forest Regressor (oRFR) provided superior performance compared to other models for classification and regression. Finally, the best test accuracy of 82.68% for oRFC and R 2 of 0.75 for the oRFR are obtained. Furthermore, the determined most important features of predictive models are in line with the outcomes of PALs reported in the literature. An ML framework can accurately predict the antimicrobial activity of PALs without the need for any experimental studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the antimicrobial efficacy of PALs with ML. Furthermore, ML techniques could contribute to a better understanding of plasma parameters that have a dominant role in the desired antimicrobial effect. Moreover, such findings may contribute to the definition of a plasma dose in the future. © 2023 The Author(s).

Traditionally, classical survival analysis techniques have been used to address this problem. However, these techniques are of limited usage when considering nonlinear and interaction effects among biomarkers, and high profiling survival datasets. Although supervised machine learning techniques have shown some advantages over standard statistical methods in handling high-dimensional datasets, their application to survival analysis, particularly in the context of feature-based approaches, is at best limited. A major reason behind this is the difficulty in processing censored data, which is a common component of survival analysis. In this paper, we have transformed the time-to-event prediction problem into a semi-supervised regression problem. We utilize a self-training wrapper approach, where an outer layer guides the iterative refinement of predictions. This approach enhances the performance of our model by leveraging confident predictions from censored instances. The self-training wrapper is applied in conjunction with random survival forests as the base learner. In this approach, censored observations are introduced as partially labeled observations since their predicted time (target value) should exceed the censoring time. First, the algorithm builds a base model over the observed instances and then augments them iteratively with highly confident predictions over the censored set, using a smart stopping criterion based on the censoring time. The proposed approach has been evaluated and compared on fifteen real-world survival analysis datasets, including clinical and high-dimensional data. The ability of our proposed approach to integrate partial supervision information within a semi-supervised learning strategy has enabled it to achieve competitive performance compared to baseline models, particularly in the case of a high-dimensional regime.  © 2013 IEEE.","Random survival forest; self-training; semi-supervised learning; survival analysis","Bioinformatics; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Medical applications; Supervised learning; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Random survival forest; Self-training; Semi-supervised learning; Survival analysis; Survival forests; Time to events; Timing; Tumors","F.N.

Moreover, fragility fracture patients increase the pressure on hospital bed demand. Hence, this study aims to develop a predictive model on the length of hospital stay (LOS) of geriatric fragility fracture patients using machine learning (ML) techniques. Methods: In this study, we use the basic information, such as gender, age, residence type, etc., and medical parameters of patients, such as the modified functional ambulation classification score (MFAC), elderly mobility scale (EMS), modified Barthel index (MBI) etc, to predict whether the length of stay would exceed 21 days or not. Results: Our results are promising despite the relatively small sample size of 8000 data. We develop various models with three approaches, namely (1) regularizing gradient boosting frameworks, (2) custom-built artificial neural network and (3) Google’s Wide & Deep Learning technique. Our best results resulted from our Wide & Deep model with an accuracy of 0.79, with a precision of 0.73, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.84. Feature importance analysis indicates (1) the type of hospital the patient is admitted to, (2) the mental state of the patient and (3) the length of stay at the acute hospital all have a relatively strong impact on the length of stay at palliative care. Conclusions: Applying ML techniques to improve the quality and efficiency in the healthcare sector is becoming popular in Hong Kong and around the globe, but there has not yet been research related to fragility fracture. The integration of machine learning may be useful for health-care professionals to better identify fragility fracture patients at risk of prolonged hospital stays. These findings underline the usefulness of machine learning techniques in optimizing resource allocation by identifying high risk individuals and providing appropriate management to improve treatment outcome. © 2024, The Author(s).","Fragility fracture; Geriatric hip fracture; Length of stay; Machine learning; Predictive medicine","Aged; Hip Fractures; Hong Kong; Hospitalization; Humans; Length of Stay; Machine Learning; Retrospective Studies; aged; hip fracture; Hong Kong; hospitalization; human; length of stay; machine learning; retrospective study","S.-W.

The lingering symptoms post a COVID-19 infection can significantly affect individuals who had previously contracted the virus, exerting considerable influence over their mental well-being. Prolonged recuperation associated with Long COVID has been connected with the emergence of symptoms such as depression and anxiety, all of which can have adverse effects on emotional health. This paper delves into an in-depth analysis of healthcare data pertaining to Long COVID from the Froedtert Health Medical System in Wisconsin. Through the application of advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques, we present predictive models aimed at assessing the risk of developing Mental Health Disorders (MHD) in patients diagnosed with Long COVID. Our study also encompasses the identification of pivotal features impacting MHD. To thoroughly investigate the factors that have a substantial impact on MHD, we employed the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) technique to carefully pick out essential attributes from our dataset. Given the dataset's inherent imbalance, we have employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMO-TEEN) technique to effectively address this issue. Multiple ML models have been meticulously constructed and validated using cross-validation methodologies. The results indicate that Random Forest (RF) Classifier shows better performance in comparison to other models with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.97, precision of 0.90, and recall of 0.89. Remarkably, the XGBoost Classifier also demonstrates strong predictive abilities for MHD, achieving an AUC of 0.90, precision of 0.79, and recall of 0.82. Ultimately, the crucial features identified through our predictive models hold the potential to identify individuals at risk of MHD, facilitating the delivery of targeted preventive care and essential resources.  © 2023 IEEE.","electronic health records; long COVID; machine learning; mental health disorder","Diagnosis; E-learning; Health risks; Machine learning; Patient monitoring; Risk assessment; Viruses; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health disorders; Health records; Long COVID; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Mental health; Mental health disorder; Predictive models; COVID-19","M.

Machine learning applications in kidney physiology and pathophysiology include segmenting kidney structures from imaging data and predicting conditions like acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease using electronic health records. Despite the potential of machine learning to revolutionize nephrology by providing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic tools, its adoption in kidney research has been slower than in other organ systems. Several factors contribute to this underutilization. The complexity of the kidney as an organ, with intricate physiology and specialized cell populations, makes it challenging to extrapolate bulk omics data to specific processes. In addition, kidney diseases often present with overlapping manifestations and morphological changes, making diagnosis and treatment complex. Moreover, kidney diseases receive less funding compared with other pathologies, leading to lower awareness and limited public-private partnerships. To promote the use of machine learning in kidney research, this review provides an introduction to machine learning and reviews its notable applications in renal research, such as morphological analysis, omics data examination, and disease diagnosis and prognosis.

Each year, 37.3 million falls requiring medical attention occur. Therefore, the analysis of fall risk is of great importance for prevention. Artificial intelligence (AI) represents an innovative tool for creating predictive statistical models of fall risk through data analysis. Objective: The aim of this review was to analyze the available evidence on the applications of AI in the analysis of data related to postural control and fall risk. Methods: A literature search was conducted in 6 databases with the following inclusion criteria: the articles had to be published within the last 5 years (from 2018 to 2024), they had to apply some method of AI, AI analyses had to be applied to data from samples consisting of humans, and the analyzed sample had to consist of individuals with independent walking with or without the assistance of external orthopedic devices. Results: We obtained a total of 3858 articles, of which 22 were finally selected. Data extraction for subsequent analysis varied in the different studies: 82% (18/22) of them extracted data through tests or functional assessments, and the remaining 18% (4/22) of them extracted through existing medical records. Different AI techniques were used throughout the articles. All the research included in the review obtained accuracy values of >70% in the predictive models obtained through AI. Conclusions: The use of AI proves to be a valuable tool for creating predictive models of fall risk. The use of this tool could have a significant socioeconomic impact as it enables the development of low-cost predictive models with a high level of accuracy. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

The conventional techniques for diagnosing and managing sleep disorders usually rely on subjective assessments and qualitative evaluations, that may have some accuracy and efficacy limitations. Nevertheless, recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have presented new opportunities for better diagnosing and treating problems with insomnia. The paper reviews in depth the uses of AI in the domain of medical sleep medicine. We look at the use of algorithmic techniques for deep learning and machine learning for identifying indicators of sleep-related issues, the assessment of sleep quality, sleep tracking, and the establishment of individualized sleep therapeutics. We also discuss how AI is being used to construct forecasting models that may be used to identify individuals who are at risk of experiencing sleep issues and improve treatment strategies. In addition, we talk about the challenges and potential outcomes of incorporating AI-based techniques into clinical practice. Overall, our research highlights how AI has the potential to transform the field of sleeping medicine and improve outcomes for people with sleep-related conditions. © 2023 IEEE.","applications; Artificial intelligence; data analysis; deep learning; machine learning; predictive models; sleep disorder management; sleep disorders; sleep disorders diagnosis; sleep medicine; sleep monitoring; sleep quality; sleep therapy; sleep tracking; treatment","Deep learning; Learning systems; Quality control; Sleep research; Deep learning; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Sleep disorder diagnose; Sleep disorder management; Sleep disorders; Sleep medicine; Sleep monitoring; Sleep quality; Sleep therapy; Sleep tracking; Treatment; Diagnosis","","Jat D.S.; Shava F.B.; Tripathi M.; Gajrani J.; Nehra A.; Jain A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835031487-8","","","English","Int.

Lab tests, medical instruments, and other sources generate a significant portion of patient healthcare data, which may contain imprecision ranges of up to 20%. However, previous studies have shown that prediction models built from such imprecise data tend to be “brittle” or unstable. Even a minor deviation within the normal imprecision range can lead to varying prediction results. Measuring the stability of such models is a crucial challenge for public health agencies in large cities in China. In this paper, we report our preliminary results on measuring stability, specifically, develop a “voting” based metric to assess the predictive stability of a model. We also formulate an effective method to calculate this metric that allows us to observe, understand, and compare the predictive stability of a model at a finer granularity. We conducted experiments on the MIMIC dataset and a predefined dataset to test the baseline method and two commonly used improved methods for handling noisy and imprecise data. The results showed that the improved methods demonstrated lower instability than the original method, highlighting the soundness of our evaluation metrics. Notably, when two models had similar accuracy for the same task, our evaluation metric identifies varying levels of stability among the models, suggesting that our proposed method provides a valuable perspective for model selection that deserves further explanation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","data imprecision; evaluation metric; prediction stability","Health care; Hospital data processing; Learning systems; Stability; Statistical tests; Data imprecision; Evaluation metrics; Imprecise data; Large cities; Machine learning techniques; Medical instruments; Patient data; Prediction modelling; Prediction stability; Public-health agencies; Forecasting","M.

Early detection is critical to prevent cancer from becoming malignant. Diagnostic tests include mammogram, ultrasound, MRI, or biopsy. Machine Learning algorithms can play a key role in analyzing complex clinical datasets to predict disease outcomes. This study uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze publicly available clinical and medical image data. For clinical data, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are applied on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset (WDBC) for feature selection and evaluate the performance of each modality in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. The results obtained show that the Random Forest (RF) classifier outperforms other classification algorithms using both PSO and PCA feature selections, achieving predictive accuracies of 95.7% and 97.2% respectively. The first part of the paper contains a comprehensive analysis of the two feature selection methods on clinical data to optimize predictive performance. The second part of the paper is concerned with image data. Although Histopathological Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has been validated for a variety of pathological applications for over two decades of manual detection of cancerous tumors, it remains challenging and prone to human error. With the potential of deep learning models to aid pathologists in detecting cancer subtypes, and the increasing predictive ability of current image analysis techniques in identifying the underlying genomic data and cancer-causing mutations, the second half of the paper focusses on feature extraction using a deep convolutional neural network (U-Net) trained on WSI’s from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to accurately classify and extract relevant features. The focus is on feature extraction, nuclei-based instance segmentation, H&E-stained image extraction, and quantifying intensity information for a given WSI to classify the disease type. A comprehensive analysis of feature selection methods is presented for both clinical and medical image data. © 2023 Sarfaraz Ahmed Mohammed, et al.","Breast cancer; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Digital image analysis; Feature selection; H&E-stained images; Histopathol-ogy; K-Means; k-NN; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Naïve bayes classification; Nuclei segmentation; Particle swarm optimization; Principal component analysis; Random forest; Support vector machines; TCGA; Whole slide images","","S.A.

The study utilized raw data related to dispensaries, EPS, and eRD acquired from the National Health Service online medical database. To achieve this objective, exploratory data analysis was conducted on the dataset, which was then split into a training set and a testing set. Various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, were applied to the training set to develop a predictive model. The models were evaluated using measurements such as the “Score”, “Mean Squared Error (MSE)”, “Mean Absolute Error (MAE)”, “Sqrt Mean Absolute Error (MAE)” and “Coefficient of determination (R^2)”. The study found that the machine learning models developed were effective in predicting EPS utilisation and could categorize GP practices based on their usage patterns. This categorization could help identify high-utilization practices, leading to more efficient resource allocation and ultimately improved healthcare delivery.

An automatic noise detection method would offer significant utility for various domains. As data labeling is onerous, having a minimally supervised abnormality detection method for input data, as well as an estimation of the severity of the signal corruptness, is essential. We propose a model-free, time-series biomedical waveform noise detection framework using a Variational Autoencoder coupled with Gaussian Mixture Models, which can detect a range of waveform abnormalities without annotation, providing a confidence metric for each segment. Our technique operates on biomedical signals that exhibit periodicity of heart activities. This framework can be applied to any machine learning or deep learning model as an initial signal validator component. Moreover, the confidence score generated by the proposed framework can be incorporated into different models' optimization to construct confidence-aware modeling. The result confirms that our approach removes noisy cardiac cycles and the remaining signals, classified as clean, exhibit a 59.92% reduction in the standard deviation of DTW distances. Using a dataset of bio-impedance data of 97885 cardiac cycles, we further demonstrate a significant improvement in the downstream task of cuffless blood pressure estimation, with an average reduction of 2.67 mmHg root mean square error (RMSE) of Diastolic Blood pressure and 2.13 mmHg RMSE of systolic blood pressure, with increases of average Pearson correlation of 0.28 and 0.08, with a statistically significant improvement of signal-to-noise ratio respectively in the presence of different synthetic noise sources.  © 2013 IEEE.","Biomarker estimation; biomedical signal processing; deep learning; Gaussian mixture models; variational autoencoder","Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Blood pressure; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Heart; Mean square error; Medical applications; Physiological models; Signal to noise ratio; Time series; Wearable sensors; biological marker; Auto encoders; Biological system modeling; Biomarker estimation; Biomedical signals processing; Deep learning; Features extraction; Gaussian Mixture Model; Noise measurements; Predictive models; Variational autoencoder; Article; autoencoder; biomedical signal processing; classification algorithm; deep learning; diastolic blood pressure; dynamic time warping; heart cycle; heart rate variability; human; impedance; mathematical model; noise measurement; QRS complex; root mean squared error; signal noise ratio; signal processing; systolic blood pressure; time series analysis; waveform; Biomedical signal processing","Z.

This study examines the medical records of 3205 STEMI patients admitted to the coronary care unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from January 2014 to December 2021. In this research, a novel predictive framework for STEMI is proposed, incorporating evolutionary computational methods and machine learning techniques. A variant algorithm, AGCOSCA, is introduced by integrating crossover operation and observation bee strategy into the original Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). The effectiveness of AGCOSCA is initially validated using IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark functions, demonstrating its ability to mitigate the deficiency in local mining after SCA random perturbation. Building upon this foundation, the AGCOSCA approach has been paired with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to forge the predictive framework referred to as AGCOSCA-SVM. Specifically, AGCOSCA is employed to refine the selection of predictors from a substantial feature set before SVM is utilized to forecast the occurrence of STEMI. In our analysis, we observed that SVM excels at managing nonlinear data relationships, a strength that becomes particularly prominent in smaller datasets of STEMI patients. To assess the effectiveness of AGCOSCA-SVM, diagnostic experiments were conducted based on the STEMI sample data. Results indicate that AGCOSCA-SVM outperforms traditional machine learning methods, achieving superior Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity values of 97.83 %, 93.75 %, and 96.67 %, respectively. The selected features, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) stage, fibrinogen, mean platelet volume (MPV), free triiodothyronine (FT3), diuretics, and Killip class during hospitalization, are identified as crucial for predicting STEMI. In conclusion, AGCOSCA-SVM emerges as a promising model framework for supporting the diagnostic process of STEMI, showcasing potential applications in clinical settings. © 2024","Feature selection; Sine cosine algorithm; ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction; Support vector machine","Animals; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Machine Learning; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Risk Factors; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Feature Selection; Hospitals; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Random processes; acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; anticoagulant agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; clopidogrel; diuretic agent; enkephalinase inhibitor; ezetimibe; fibrinogen; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; liothyronine; ticagrelor; Coronary arteries; Features selection; Hospital mortality; Machine learning approaches; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial infarction patients; Sine-cosine algorithm; ST segment; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; Support vectors machine; acute heart infarction; acute kidney failure; adult; Article; cardiac patient; cardiovascular mortality; classification algorithm; classifier; controlled study; coronary care unit; diagnostic accuracy; diuretic therapy; evolutionary algorithm; feature selection; female; free liothyronine index; human; in-hospital mortality; k nearest neighbor; kernel method; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; mean platelet volume; medical record review; modified sine cosine algorithm; particle swarm optimization; population size; qualitative analysis; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; support vector machine; thrombus aspiration; animal; heart arrhythmia; hospital mortality; machine learning; percutaneous coronary intervention; procedures; risk factor; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; Support vector machines","P.

Increasing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices requires access to real-time data over robust and secure network infrastructures. During the lifetime of healthcare applications, the data must be transferred in a controlled manner. In this context, this study proposes, an IoT-based decision support system for the analysis of Covid-related data in healthcare systems. Through in-vehicle monitoring, it is intended to safely send important data and patient updates to attending physicians. The suggested approach uses feature extraction methods to identify patients' crucial states while protecting their private information. To improve feature extraction, two techniques are combined: ensemble classification and cipher substitution for secure Json Web Tokens (JWTs). By incorporating the Secure Hashing Algorithm-2 (SHA-2) methods into the Feature Extraction based Logistic Regression (FELR), security protections are substantially reinforced. The system uses the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to provide secure communication between devices and access to the extracted characteristics from rescue vehicles. The system analyzes passengers, traffic data, and medical issues, which are continually updated with cloud-based security, by using vehicle-based communication networks. The secure movement of patient data inside the hospital network is ensured by this cloud-based system. By using sophisticated regression analysis and ensemble learning approaches, our suggested methodology has shown significant advantages compared to traditional models such as Logistic Regression (LR) and Mixed Regression (MR). Our technique demonstrates exceptional performance with an accuracy rate of 96%, a recall rate of 91%, and an F-measure of 91%. We also precisely compared the performance of our proposed FELR algorithm with hybrid prediction model using deep learning, the extra tree convolutional neural network-based ensemble model, ensemble-based random forest, ensemble transformation learning, and machine learning with regression. Significantly, FELR algorithm has demonstrated exceptional superiority by consistently surpassing the predictive capabilities of all these algorithms. The system has exceptional performance and exhibits improved efficiency and secure transmission capabilities. The unique model that we propose offers a feasible and effective approach for detecting crucial states in patients within healthcare facilities. The success of our framework is shown via a well-planned approach that includes important processes such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, ensemble model construction, and evaluation. The proposed framework offers a promising avenue for aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding the critical health trajectories of COVID-19 patients. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Covid data; JSON web tokens (JWT); Logistic regression; Machine learning (ML); SHA-2 algorithm","COVID-19; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Extraction; Health care; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Vehicles; Covid data; Ensemble classification; Features extraction; Hashing algorithms; JSON web token; Logistics regressions; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Performance; Secure hashing algorithm-2 algorithm; Feature extraction","A.

This review explores a revolutionary shift in predictive modeling through the application of deep learning (DL), specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using transformation methods such as DeepInsight, omics data with independent variables in tabular (table-like, including vector) form can be turned into image-like representations, enabling CNNs to capture latent features effectively. This approach not only enhances predictive power but also leverages transfer learning, reducing computational time, and improving performance. However, integrating CNNs in predictive omics data analysis is not without challenges, including issues related to model interpretability, data heterogeneity, and data size. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaborations between ML experts, bioinformatics researchers, biologists, and medical doctors. This review illuminates these complexities and charts a course for future research to unlock the full predictive potential of CNNs in omics data analysis and related fields. © The Author(s) 2024.","","bioinformatics; biologist; convolutional neural network; data analysis; deep learning; explosion; high throughput sequencing; human; machine learning; omics; personalized medicine; prediction; predictive model; review; transfer of learning","A.

The first scenario discusses how online service providers accurately understand consumer preferences and needs through the use of AI-powered big data analysis. The author, a clinical nephrologist, contemplates the potential application of similar methodologies, including AI, in his medical practice to better understand and meet patient needs. The second scenario presents a case study of a 20-year-old man with IgAN. The patient exhibited recurring symptoms, including gross haematuria and tonsillitis, over a 2-year period. Through histological examination and treatment with renin–angiotensin system blockade and corticosteroids, the patient experienced significant improvement in kidney function and reduced proteinuria over 15 years of follow-up. The case highlights the importance of individualized treatment strategies and the use of predictive tools, such as AI-based predictive models, in assessing treatment response and predicting long-term outcomes in IgAN patients. The article further discusses the collection and analysis of real-world big data, including electronic health records, for studying disease natural history, predicting treatment responses and identifying prognostic biomarkers. Challenges in integrating data from various sources and issues such as missing data and data processing limitations are also addressed. Mathematical models, including logistic regression and Cox regression analysis, are discussed for predicting clinical outcomes and analysing changes in variables over time. Additionally, the application of machine learning algorithms, including AI techniques, in analysing big data and predicting outcomes in IgAN is explored. In conclusion, the article highlights the potential benefits of leveraging AI-powered big data analysis, predictive monitoring and machine learning algorithms to enhance patient care and improve treatment outcomes in IgAN. © The Author(s) 2023.

Radiogenomics is an extension of radiomics that combines conventional radiomics techniques with molecular analysis in the form of genomic and transcriptomic data, serving as an alternative to costly, labour-intensive genetic testing. Data on radiomics and radiogenomics in the field of pelvic oncology remain novel concepts in the literature. We aim to perform an up-to-date analysis of current applications of radiomics and radiogenomics in the field of pelvic oncology, particularly focusing on the prediction of survival, recurrence and treatment response. Several studies have applied these concepts to colorectal, urological, gynaecological and sarcomatous diseases, with individual efficacy yet poor reproducibility. This article highlights the current applications of radiomics and radiogenomics in pelvic oncology, as well as the current limitations and future directions. Despite a rapid increase in publications investigating the use of radiomics and radiogenomics in pelvic oncology, the current evidence is limited by poor reproducibility and small datasets. In the era of personalised medicine, this novel field of research has significant potential, particularly for predicting prognosis and guiding therapeutic decisions. Future research may provide fundamental data on how we treat this cohort of patients, with the aim of reducing the exposure of high-risk patients to highly morbid procedures. © 2023 by the authors.","oncology; radiogenomics; radiomics; recurrence; survival; treatment response","Diagnostic Imaging; Genetic Testing; Humans; Medical Oncology; Reproducibility of Results; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; protein p53; area under the curve; artificial intelligence; bladder cancer; computer assisted tomography; data analysis; decision making; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; endometrium cancer; genotyping; glucose metabolism; human; lymph node metastasis; machine learning; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; noninvasive prenatal testing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oncology; ovary cancer; overall survival; Pelvic Oncology; personalized medicine; positron emission tomography; predictive value; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; radiogenomics; radiomics; reproducibility; Review; sarcoma; sensitivity and specificity; treatment response; diagnostic imaging; genetic screening","N.J.

Recent advances in quantitative imaging and specifically the application of radiomics has proved to be a very promising technique, facilitating both diagnosis and therapy. The purpose of this study is to assess radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1w Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps for the evaluation of breast pathologies. Methods: MRI data from 52 women were retrospectively reviewed, involving 54 breast lesions, both malignant and benign. Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) was applied as a standard MRΙ protocol, including dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRΙ in all cases. All patients were examined on a 1.5T MRI scanner, and 216 features were initially extracted from DCE-MRI images. Histological analysis of the breast lesions was performed, and a comparative analysis of the results was carried out to assess the accuracy of the method. Results: Following surgery and histological analysis, 30 lesions were found to be malignant and 24 benign. Implementation of a Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithm with 5-fold cross-validation resulted in a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 66%, Negative Predictive Value of 82% and overall accuracy of 67% in differentiating malignancy from benevolence. Conclusion: Texture analysis and ML methodology based on the first post-contrast dynamic sequences and ADC maps may be employed to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions, offering a promising new tool for diagnostic analysis. Implications for practice: The results of this study will enhance knowledge around application and performance of radiomics in breast MRI, thus helping MRI radiographers who use AI-enabled technologies to better delineate the pros and cons of these procedures. © 2023 The College of Radiographers","","Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Contrast Media; Female; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; contrast medium; accuracy; adult; aged; algorithm; apparent diffusion coefficient; area under the curve; Article; breast cancer; breast lesion; breast magnetic resonance imaging; cancer surgery; classification algorithm; contrast enhancement; cross validation; cystectomy; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diffusion weighted imaging; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; echo planar imaging; echography; female; fractional anisotropy; histology; human; human tissue; image quality; machine learning; major clinical study; menstrual cycle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; predictive value; radiographer; radiomics; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; support vector machine; texture analysis; breast; breast tumor; diagnostic imaging; pathology","N.

Data sources The acronym PIRDs was used and a comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, Embase, Scielo, EBSCOhost, and grey literature through Proquest, Google Scholar, and JSTOR for systematic reviews of AI as a diagnostic model and/or detection tool for any cancer type in adult patients, compared to the traditional diagnostic radiographic imaging model. There were no limits on publishing status, publication time, or language. For study selection and risk of bias evaluation, pairs of reviewers worked separately. Results In total, 382 records were retrieved in the databases, 364 after removing duplicates, 32 satisfied the full-text reading criterion, and 09 papers were considered for qualitative synthesis. Although there was heterogeneity in terms of methodological aspects, patient differences, and techniques used, the studies found that several AI approaches are promising in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy in the detection and diagnosis of malignant tumors. When compared to other machine learning algorithms, the Super Vector Machine method performed better in cancer detection and diagnosis. Computer-assisted detection (CAD) has shown promising in terms of aiding cancer detection, when compared to the traditional method of diagnosis. Conclusions The detection and diagnosis of malignant tumors with the help of AI seems to be feasible and accurate with the use of different technologies, such as CAD systems, deep and machine learning algorithms and radiomic analysis when compared with the traditional model, although these technologies are not capable of to replace the professional radiologist in the analysis of medical images. Although there are limitations regarding the generalization for all types of cancer, these AI tools might aid professionals, serving as an auxiliary and teaching tool, especially for less trained professionals. Therefore, further longitudinal studies with a longer follow-up duration are required for a better understanding of the clinical application of these artificial intelligence systems.

Our approach involved the application of a Random Forest classifier to a dataset comprising 50 relevant features. To mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model robustness, we randomly divided these features into subsets of 10, iteratively training and testing the classifier. The final prediction was based on the majority vote from five classifiers. Our results demonstrated remarkable success in ovarian cancer detection. The Random Forest classifier exhibited an outstanding accuracy of 0.98 on the test dataset, indicating its proficiency in distinguishing between ovarian cancer cases and non-cancer cases. Precision-Recall analysis further underscored the model's effectiveness, with an impressive average precision (AP) of 0.98. This high AP value underscores the model's capability to provide highprecision predictions, which is particularly crucial in medical applications, where minimizing false alarms is of paramount importance. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning, specifically Random Forest, as a valuable tool in ovarian cancer detection. The combination of feature subset selection and ensemble learning techniques led to a robust and reliable predictive model. While these results are promising, ongoing validation and collaboration with domain experts are essential steps toward the translation of this research into clinical practice, where early and accurate cancer detection can have a profound impact on patient outcomes.  © 2023 IEEE.","Average precision; Machine learning; Medical diagnosis; Ovarian cancer; Precision-Recall analysis; Random Forest","Classification (of information); Clinical research; Diseases; Feature Selection; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical applications; Statistical tests; Average precision; Cancer detection; Critical tasks; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Ovarian cancers; Precision prediction; Precision-recall analyse; Random forest classifier; Random forests; Diagnosis","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835034060-0","","","English","Int.

This urgency and shift toward smart policing incorporates artificial intelligence (AI), with a specific focus on machine learning (ML) as an essential tool for data analysis, pattern recognition, and proactive crime forecasting. Among these, the flexibility and power of AI techniques including large language models (LLMs), as a subset of generative AI, have increased the interest in applying them in real-world applications, such as financial, medical, legal, and agricultural applications. However, the abilities and possibilities of adopting LLMs in applications including crime prediction remain unexplored. This paper focuses on bridging this gap by developing a framework based on the transformative potential of BART, GPT-3, and GPT-4, three state-of-the-art LLMs, in the domain of smart policing, specifically, crime prediction. As a prototype, diverse methods such as zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning are used to comprehensively assess the performance of these models in crime prediction based on state-of-the-art datasets from two major cities: San Francisco and Los Angeles. The main objective is to illuminate the adaptability of LLMs and their capacity to revolutionize crime analysis practices. Additionally, a comparative analysis of the aforementioned methods on the GPT series model and BART with ML techniques is provided which shows that the GPT models are more suitable than the traditional ML models for crime classification in most experimental scenarios.  © 2013 IEEE.","Crime prediction; few-shot prompting; fine-tuning; large language models; LLM; zero-shot prompting","Computational linguistics; Crime; Data handling; Job analysis; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Recurrent neural networks; Adaptation models; Crime prediction; Few-shot prompting; Fine tuning; Language model; Large language model; Predictive models; Task analysis; Zero-shot prompting; Forecasting","P.

Discerning characteristic Bragg intensity peaks and assigning them to known crystalline phases is the first qualitative step of evaluating diffraction spectra. Subsequent to phase identification, Rietveld refinement may be employed to extract the abundance of quantitative, material-specific parameters hidden within powder data. These characterization procedures are yet time-consuming and inhibit efficiency in materials science workflows. The ever-increasing popularity and propulsion of data science techniques has provided an obvious solution on the course toward materials analysis automation. Deep learning has become a prime focus for predicting crystallographic parameters and features from X-ray spectra. However, the infeasibility of curating large, well-labeled experimental datasets means that one must resort to a large number of theoretic simulations for powder data augmentation to effectively train deep models. Herein, we are interested in conventional supervised learning algorithms in lieu of deep learning for multi-label crystalline phase identification and quantitative phase analysis for a biomedical application. First, models were trained using very limited experimental data. Further, we incorporated simulated XRD data to assess model generalizability as well as the efficacy of simulation-based training for predictive analysis in a real-world X-ray diffraction application. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Bioinformatics; Deep learning; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Medical applications; Supervised learning; X ray powder diffraction; Bragg intensity; Characterization procedures; Critical component; Crystalline phasis; Diffraction spectra; Materials characterization; Phase identification; Phase quantification; Supervised machine learning; X-ray diffraction spectrum; Rietveld refinement","J.

This focus is reflected in conference topics, strategy documents, technology appraisals and funding streams. What is often overlooked is the wider application of data and AI, as demonstrated through published literature and emerging marketplace products, that offers promising avenues for enhanced clinical care, health-service efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This review provides an overview of AI techniques and explores the use and potential of AI and data-driven systems in a broad context, covering all diabetes types, encompassing: (1) patient education and self-management; (2) clinical decision support systems and predictive analytics, including diagnostic support, treatment and screening advice, complications prediction; and (3) the use of multimodal data, such as imaging or genetic data. The review provides a perspective on how data- and AI-driven systems could transform diabetes care in the coming years and how they could be integrated into daily clinical practice. We discuss evidence for benefits and potential harms, and consider existing barriers to scalable adoption, including challenges related to data availability and exchange, health inequality, clinician hesitancy and regulation. Stakeholders, including clinicians, academics, commissioners, policymakers and those with lived experience, must proactively collaborate to realise the potential benefits that AI-supported diabetes care could bring, whilst mitigating risk and navigating the challenges along the way.

Yet, there is a limited understanding of how these advanced computational techniques are employed in cancer nursing to inform clinical practice. This review aimed to identify and synthesise evidence on artificial intelligence in cancer nursing. Methods: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched using key terms between January 2010 and December 2022. Titles, abstracts, and then full texts were screened against eligibility criteria, resulting in twenty studies being included. Critical appraisal was undertaken, and relevant data extracted and analysed. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Results: Artificial intelligence was used in numerous areas including breast, colorectal, liver, and ovarian cancer care among others. Algorithms were trained and tested on primary and secondary datasets to build predictive models of health problems related to cancer. Studies reported this led to improvements in the accuracy of predicting health outcomes or identifying variables that improved outcome prediction. While nurses led most studies, few deployed an artificial intelligence based digital tool with cancer nurses in a real-world setting as studies largely focused on developing and validating predictive models. Conclusion: Electronic cancer nursing datasets should be established to enable artificial intelligence techniques to be tested and if effective implemented in digital prediction and other AI-based tools. Cancer nurses need more education on machine learning and natural language processing, so they can lead and contribute to artificial intelligence developments in oncology. © 2024 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Cancer nursing; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Oncology","Artificial Intelligence; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Medical Oncology; Oncology Nursing; Ovarian Neoplasms; artificial intelligence; educational status; female; human; oncology; oncology nursing; ovary tumor","S.

Machine learning models have demonstrated their potential as virtual QA tools, accurately predicting the gamma passing rate (GPR) of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there is limited multi-center research dedicated to predicting the GPR. In this study, a dosiomics-based machine learning approach was employed to construct a prediction model for classifying GPR in multiple radiotherapy institutions. Additionally, the model’s performance was compared by evaluating the impact of two distinct feature selection methods. Methods: A retrospective data collection was conducted on 572 VMAT patients across three radiotherapy institutions. Utilizing a three-dimensional dose verification technique grounded in real-time measurements, γ analysis was conducted according to the criteria of 3%/2 mm and 2%/2 mm, employing a dose threshold of 10% along with absolute dose and global normalization mode. Dosiomics features were extracted from the dose files, and distinct subsets of features were selected as inputs for the model using the random forest (RF) and RF combined with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods. The data underwent training using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, and the model’s classification performance was assessed through F1-score and area under the curve (AUC) values. Results: The model exhibited optimal performance under the 3%/2 mm criteria, utilizing a subset of 20 features and attaining an AUC value of 0.88 and an F1-score of 0.89. Similarly, under the 2%/2 mm criteria, the model demonstrated superior performance with a subset of 10 features, resulting in an AUC value of 0.91 and an F1-score of 0.89. The feature selection methods of RF and RF + SHAP have achieved good model performance by selecting as few features as possible. Conclusion: Based on the multi-center PSQA results, it is possible to utilize dosiomics features extracted from dose files to construct a machine learning predictive model. This model demonstrates excellent discriminative abilities, thus promoting the progress of gamma passing rate prognostic models in clinical application and implementation. Furthermore, it holds potential in providing patients with secure and efficient personalized QA management, while also reducing the workload of medical physicists.

This scoping review aimed to identify the barriers encountered in applying innovative AI techniques and models in developing breast cancer risk prediction scores and promoting screening behaviors among adult females. Findings may inform and guide future global recommendations for AI application in breast cancer prevention and care for female populations. Methods: The PRISMA-SCR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) was used as a reference checklist throughout this study. The Arksey and O’Malley methodology was used as a framework to guide this review. The framework methodology consisted of five steps: (1) Identify research questions; (2) Search for relevant studies; (3) Selection of studies relevant to the research questions; (4) Chart the data; (5) Collate, summarize, and report the results. Results: In the field of breast cancer risk detection and prevention, the following AI techniques and models have been applied: Machine and Deep Learning Model (ML-DL model) (n = 1), Academic Algorithms (n = 2), Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), Clinical 5-Year Risk Prediction Model (n = 2), deep-learning computer vision AI algorithms (n = 2), AI-based thermal imaging solution (Thermalytix) (n = 1), RealRisks (n = 2), Breast Cancer Risk NAVIgation (n = 1), MammoRisk (ML-Based Tool) (n = 1), Various MLModels (n = 1), and various machine/deep learning, decision aids, and commercial algorithms (n = 7). In the 11 included studies, a total of 39 barriers to AI applications in breast cancer risk prediction and screening efforts were identified. The most common barriers in the application of innovative AI tools for breast cancer prediction and improved screening rates included lack of external validity and limited generalizability (n = 6), as AI was used in studies with either a small sample size or datasets with missing data. Many studies (n = 5) also encountered selection bias due to exclusion of certain populations based on characteristics such as race/ethnicity, family history, or past medical history. Several recommendations for future research should be considered. AI models need to include a broader spectrum and more complete predictive variables for risk assessment. Investigating long-term outcomes with improved follow-up periods is critical to assess the impacts of AI on clinical decisions beyond just the immediate outcomes. Utilizing AI to improve communication strategies at both a local and organizational level can assist in informed decision-making and compliance, especially in populations with limited literacy levels.

It is used to predict outcomes of interest or classify positive and/or negative cases with a known ground truth. Supervised learning describes a spectrum of techniques, ranging from traditional regression modeling to more complex tree boosting, which are becoming increasingly prevalent as the focus on “big data” develops. While these tools are becoming increasingly popular and powerful, there is a paucity of literature available that describe the strengths and limitations of these different modeling techniques. Typically, there is no formal training for health care professionals in the use of machine learning models. As machine learning applications throughout medicine increase, it is important that physicians and other health care professionals better understand the processes underlying application of these techniques. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of commonly used supervised learning techniques with recent case examples within the orthopedic literature. An additional goal is to address disparities in the understanding of these methods to improve communication within and between research teams. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).","Machine learning; Orthopedics; Predictive models; Sports Medicine; Statistical analysis","Algorithms; Humans; Machine Learning; Orthopedic Procedures; Supervised Machine Learning; human; learning; machine learning; orthopedic surgery; orthopedics; physician; predictive model; review; sports medicine; supervised machine learning; algorithm; machine learning","A.

CAD plays a vital role in the automatic and early detection of diseases. Health monitoring, medical database management, and picture archiving systems became very feasible with CAD, assisting radiologists in making decisions over any imaging modality. Imaging modalities mainly rely on machine learning and deep learning algorithms for early and accurate disease detection. CAD approaches are described in this paper in terms of it's their significant tools; digital image processing (DIP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Ultrasonography (USG) already has many advantages over other imaging modalities; therefore, CAD analysis of USG assists radiologists in studying it more clearly, leading to USG application over various body parts. This paper includes a review of those major diseases whose detection supports “ML algorithm” based diagnosis from USG images. ML algorithm follows feature extraction, selection, and classification in the required class. The literature survey of these diseases is grouped into the carotid region, transabdominal & pelvic region, musculoskeletal region, and thyroid region. These regions also differ in the types of transducers employed for scanning. Based on the literature survey, we have concluded that texture-based extracted features passed to support vector machine (SVM) classifier results in good classification accuracy. However, the emerging deep learning-based disease classification trend signifies more preciseness and automation for feature extraction and classification. Still, classification accuracy depends on the number of images used for training the model. This motivated us to highlight some of the significant shortcomings of automated disease diagnosis techniques. Research challenges in CAD-based automatic diagnosis system design and limitations in imaging through USG modality are mentioned as separate topics in this paper, indicating future scope and improvement in this field. The success rate of machine learning approaches in USG-based automatic disease detection motivated this review paper to describe different parameters behind machine learning and deep learning algorithms towards improving USG diagnostic performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

Decision support systems based on AI have improved the assessment of treatment efficacy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. AI-assisted cystoscopy has demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity in identifying and categorizing bladder lesions, potentially outperforming human urologists. ML algorithms, including artificial neural networks, have shown superior predictive capabilities in prognosis and outcome prediction compared to conventional models. Radiomics and ML techniques have enhanced bladder cancer staging and treatment response assessment through accurate analysis of imaging data. AI-driven biomarker discovery, including metabolomics, has the potential to revolutionize non-invasive bladder cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Automated histologic grading and molecular typing facilitated by AI have led to faster and more precise diagnoses, enabling personalized treatment plans. The integration of AI and ML in bladder cancer diagnosis has the potential to improve patient outcomes significantly. By providing faster and more precise diagnoses, AI-driven approaches can enhance treatment planning and response evaluation. Additionally, AI-assisted cystoscopy and improved biomarkers can lead to less invasive and more effective diagnostic techniques.

The gold standard for human opisthorchiasis laboratory diagnosis is the routine examination of Opisthorchis spp. eggs under a microscope. Manual detection is laborious, time-consuming, and dependent on the microscopist’s abilities and expertise. Automatic screening of Opisthorchis spp. eggs with deep learning techniques is a useful diagnostic aid. Methods: Herein, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying and automatically detecting O. viverrini eggs from digitized images. The image data acquisition was acquired from infected human feces and was processed using the gold standard formalin ethyl acetate concentration technique, and then captured under the microscope digital camera at 400x. Microscopic images containing artifacts and O.viverrini egg were augmented using image rotation, filtering, noising, and sharpening techniques. This augmentation increased the image dataset from 1 time to 36 times in preparation for the training and validation step. Furthermore, the overall dataset was subdivided into a training-validation and test set at an 80:20 ratio, trained with a five-fold cross-validation to test model stability. For model training, we customized a CNN for image classification. An object detection method was proposed using a patch search algorithm to detect eggs and their locations. A performance matrix was used to evaluate model efficiency after training and IoU analysis for object detection. Results: The proposed model, initially trained on non-augmented data of artifacts (class 0) and O. viverrini eggs (class 1), showed limited performance with 50.0% accuracy, 25.0% precision, 50.0% recall, and a 33.0% F1-score. After implementing data augmentation, the model significantly improved, reaching 100% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Stability assessments using 5-fold cross-validation indicated better stability with augmented data, evidenced by an ROC-AUC metric improvement from 0.5 to 1.00. Compared to other models such as ResNet50, InceptionV3, VGG16, DenseNet121, and Xception, the proposed model, with a smaller file size of 2.7 MB, showed comparable perfect performance. In object detection, the augmented data-trained model achieved an IoU score over 0.5 in 139 out of 148 images, with an average IoU of 0.6947. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the successful application of CNN in classifying and automating the detection of O. viverrini eggs in human stool samples. Our CNN model’s performance metrics and true positive detection rates were outstanding. This innovative application of deep learning can automate and improve diagnostic precision, speed, and efficiency, particularly in regions where O. viverrini infections are prevalent, thereby possibly improving infection sustainable control and treatment program. © 2024 Thanchomnang et al.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Human opisthorchiasis; Microscopic detection","acetic acid ethyl ester; praziquantel; accuracy; antigen recognition; area under the curve; Article; artifact; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; egg; feces analysis; gold standard; human; image quality; mean squared error; medical examination; nerve cell network; nonhuman; opisthorchiasis; Opisthorchis viverrini; predictive value; probability; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; training; validation process","P.

While researchers have increasingly utilised machine learning (ML) algorithms to tackle this issue, supervised ML methods remain dominant. However, there is a rising interest in unsupervised techniques, especially in situations where data labels might be missing — as seen with undiagnosed or rare diseases. This study delves into comparing unsupervised ML models for disease prediction. Methods: This study evaluated the efficacy of seven unsupervised algorithms on 15 datasets, including those of heart failure, diabetes, and breast cancer. It used six performance metrics for this comparison. They are Adjusted Rand Index, Adjusted Mutual Information, Homogeneity, Completeness, V-measure and Silhouette Coefficient. Results: Among the seven unsupervised ML methods, the DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) showed the best performance most times (31), followed by the Bayesian Gaussian Mixture (18) and Divisive clustering (15). No single model consistently outshined others across every dataset and metric. The study emphasises the crucial role of model and performance measure selections based on application-specific needs. For example, DBSCAN excels in Homogeneity, Completeness and V-measure metrics. Conversely, the Bayesian Gaussian Mixture is good in the Adjusted R and Index metric. The codes used in this study can be found at https://github.com/haohuilu/unsupervisedml/ . Conclusion: This research contributes deeper insights into the unsupervised ML applications in healthcare and encourages further investigations into model selection. Subsequent studies could harness genuine disease records for a more nuanced comparison and evaluation of models. © 2023, The Author(s).","Disease prediction; Healthcare dataset; Performance comparison; Unsupervised machine learning","Article; breast cancer; clinical effectiveness; comparative study; diabetes mellitus; heart failure; hierarchical clustering; human; performance indicator; predictive value; unsupervised machine learning","S.

Early detection and prediction of stroke occurrence can lead to better treatment outcomes and improved patient care. Wit the advent of technology, machine learning approaches have been increasingly applied to stroke prediction and diagnosis. Gradient Boosting is a popular ensemble classification technique that can be used to construct accurate predictive models for various applications, including stroke prediction. In this study, we compare the various Gradient Boosting approaches to accurately classify people which might have ischemic stroke and measure the efficiency of each of these algorithms. The various algorithms namely the XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost are compared by tackling the various problems of data preprocessing like class imbalance. The algorithms are compared by tuning the hyperparameters and the results show that they can accurately predict the occurrence of ischemic stroke with an accuracy of about 96%. The feature importance analysis reveals that age, hypertension, and BMI are the most significant predictors of stroke occurrence. The results conclude that XGBoost overperforms the other two algorithm and can be a promising approach to detect and determine the ischemic strokes, allowing for better handling of the medical facilities and timely prevention of the disease improving patient healthcare.  © 2023 IEEE.","Brain Stroke; CatBoost; Gradient Boost; Ischemic stroke; LightGBM; XGBoost","Adaptive boosting; Chemical detection; Computer aided diagnosis; Patient treatment; Brain strokes; Catboost; Gradient boost; Gradient boosting; Ischemic strokes; Lightgbm; Machine learning approaches; Patient care; Treatment outcomes; Xgboost; Forecasting","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835034112-6","","","English","Int.

Recently, there have been increasing uptakes of Big Data techniques in basic, clinical, and public health fields of HIV/AIDS research. However, no studies have systematically elaborated on the evolving applications of Big Data in HIV/AIDS research. We sought to explore the emergence and evolution of Big Data Science in HIV/AIDS-related publications that were funded by the US federal agencies. Methods: We identified HIV/AIDS and Big Data related publications that were funded by seven federal agencies from 2000 to 2019 by integrating data from National Institutes of Health (NIH) ExPORTER, MEDLINE, and MeSH. Building on bibliometrics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we constructed co-occurrence networks using bibliographic metadata (e.g., countries, institutes, MeSH terms, and keywords) of the retrieved publications. We then detected clusters among the networks as well as the temporal dynamics of clusters, followed by expert evaluation and clinical implications. Results: We harnessed nearly 600 thousand publications related to HIV/AIDS, of which 19,528 publications relating to Big Data were included in bibliometric analysis. Results showed that (1) the number of Big Data publications has been increasing since 2000, (2) US institutes have been in close collaborations with China, Canada, and Germany, (3) some institutes (e.g., University of California system, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Harvard Medical School) are among the most productive institutes and started using Big Data in HIV/AIDS research early, (4) Big Data research was not active in public health disciplines until 2015, (5) research topics such as genomics, HIV comorbidities, population-based studies, Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, precision medicine, and methodologies such as machine learning, Deep Learning, radiomics, and data mining emerge quickly in recent years. Conclusions: We identified a rapid growth in the cross-disciplinary research of HIV/AIDS and Big Data over the past two decades. Our findings demonstrated patterns and trends of prevailing research topics and Big Data applications in HIV/AIDS research and suggested a number of fast-evolving areas of Big Data Science in HIV/AIDS research including secondary analysis of EHR, machine learning, Deep Learning, predictive analysis, and NLP. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","AIDS; Bibliometrics; Big data; Data mining; Electronic health records; HIV; PLWH","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Bibliometrics; Big Data; Data Science; Humans; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); United States; Big data; Clinical research; Deep learning; Diseases; Learning systems; Medical computing; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Natural language processing systems; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Population statistics; Predictive analytics; Public health; Publishing; Big data applications; Co-occurrence networks; Cross-disciplinary research; Electronic health record; Harvard Medical School; National Institutes of Health; NAtural language processing; University of California; bibliometrics; big data; California; Canada; China; clinical evaluation; comorbidity; data mining; deep learning; electronic health record; genomics; Germany; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; interdisciplinary research; medical school; Medical Subject Headings; Medline; metadata; national health organization; natural language processing; nonhuman; personalized medicine; radiomics; review; secondary analysis; social media; systematic review; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; bibliometrics; United States; Data mining","C.

This paper presents an analysis of sound measurements of cough events from the point of view of their predictive content with respect to identification of different types of cough, including positive COVID-19 cases. The data consisted of a collection of audio samples collected from different sources including dry, wet, whooping and COVID-19 coughs. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques were used to reveal the underlying structure of the data, described by dissimilarity spaces constructed from pair-wise dynamic time warping measures derived from the original sound measurements. Intrinsic dimensionality, nonlinear mappings to low-dimensional spaces and visual cluster assessment techniques allowed a representation of the cough types distribution. Supervised classification techniques were used to obtain models identifying cough classes and high performance classifiers were obtained for most of them, including COVID-19. These results are preliminary and there is potential to improve, as they were obtained directly from a small dataset, without signal preprocessing (trimming, filtering, etc.), hyperparameter tuning, ensemble models, and class imbalance handling approaches. © 2021 IEEE.","Cough events; COVID-19; Dissimilarity spaces; Dynamic time warping; Machine learning; Sound measurements","Acoustic variables measurement; Architectural acoustics; Classifiers; Learning systems; Medical applications; Turing machines; Assessment technique; Dynamic time warping; Intrinsic dimensionalities; Low-dimensional spaces; Signal preprocessing; Supervised classification; Supervised machine learning; Types distributions; Supervised learning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166541914-7","","","English","IEEE Int.

Unfortunately, accurate interpretation of radiological imaging data is constantly challenged by the indistinguishable radiological image features shared by different pathological changes associated with tumor progression and/or various therapeutic interventions. In recent years, machine learning (ML)-based artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been widely applied in medical image processing and bioinformatics due to its advantages in implicit image feature extraction and integrative data analysis. Despite its recent rapid development, ML technology still faces many hurdles for its broader applications in neuro-oncological radiomic analysis, such as lack of large accessible standardized real patient radiomic brain tumor data of all kinds and reliable predictions on tumor response upon various treatments. Therefore, understanding ML-based AI technologies is critically important to help us address the skyrocketing demands of neuro-oncology clinical deployments. Here, we provide an overview on the latest advancements in ML techniques for brain tumor radiomic analysis, emphasizing proprietary and public dataset preparation and state-of-the-art ML models for brain tumor diagnosis, classifications (e.g., primary and secondary tumors), discriminations between treatment effects (pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis) and true progression, survival prediction, inflammation, and identification of brain tumor biomarkers. We also compare the key features of ML models in the realm of neuroradiology with ML models employed in other medical imaging fields and discuss open research challenges and directions for future work in this nascent precision medicine area.

The economic burden of COPD grows continuously because it is not a curable disease. These conditions make COPD an important research field of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in medicine. In this study, an integrated approach of the statistical-based fuzzy cognitive maps (SBFCM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) is proposed for predicting length of hospital stay of patients with COPD, who admitted to the hospital with an acute exacerbation. The SBFCM method is developed to determine the input variables of the ANN model. The SBFCM conducts statistical analysis to prepare preliminary information for the experts and then collects expert opinions accordingly, to define a conceptual map of the system. The integration of SBFCM and ANN methods provides both statistical data and expert opinion in the prediction model. In the numerical application, the proposed approach outperformed the conventional approach and other machine learning algorithms with 79.95% accuracy, revealing the power of expert opinion involvement in medical decisions. A medical decision support framework is constructed for better prediction of length of hospital stay and more effective hospital management.

Medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and spectral imaging can efficiently aid physicians in diagnosing, treating, and evaluating patients with gliomas. With the increasing clinical records and digital images, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) based on medical imaging has reduced the burden on physicians treating gliomas even further. This review will classify AI technologies and procedures used in medical imaging analysis. Additionally, we will discuss the applications of AI in glioma, including tumor segmentation and classification, prediction of genetic markers, and prediction of treatment response and prognosis, using MRI, PET, and spectral imaging. Despite the benefits of AI in clinical applications, several issues such as data management, incomprehension, safety, clinical efficacy evaluation, and ethical or legal considerations, remain to be solved. In the future, doctors and researchers should collaborate to solve these issues, with a particular emphasis on interdisciplinary teamwork.

EMRs hold structured, semi-structured and unstructured demographic and health care data about patients. The value of EMR data for research, health surveillance and quality improvement continues to be explored. Data analytics such as Machine Learning (ML) and statistical modeling techniques have been applied to de-identified EMR data repositories to advance our understanding of different health conditions and patient care. More recently, the application of Deep Learning (DL) approaches to structured, semi-structured and unstructured data of the EMRs is being investigated as an avenue for improved identification of health conditions. Supervised ML methods have dominated disease classification for more prevalent diseases. A large cohort of labeled data is required to train ML models using supervised learning methods. For less common diseases, the amount of available labeled data is often insufficient, and a variety of strategies are being explored to deal with inadequate, noisy and missing data. This chapter describes the benefits of using DL models with EMR data for research to improve provisioning of health care in primary care settings. A few prominent DL models such as Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are discussed with example scenarios that demonstrate application of some of these predictive analytics models to both structured and unstructured EMR data using regular and weak supervision methods for diagnosing both prevalent and non-prevalent diseases. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Deep learning; Disease diagnosis; Electronic medical record; Machine learning; Medical data analysis; Natural language processing","","F.

It includes the usage of mobile phones or other wireless devices that are applied to rehabilitation exercises. Such applications or software include exercises in the form of virtual games, treatment monitoring based on the rehabilitation progress and data analysis. However, nowadays, physiotherapists use a default profiling setting for patients carrying out rehabilitation, due to lack of information. Medical Interactive Rehabilitation Assistant (MIRA) is a computer-based (virtual reality) rehabilitation platform. The profile setting includes: a level of difficulty, percentage of tolerance and maximum range. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of optimization in the parameter values setting of MIRA exergames that could enhance patients' performance. Generally, non-optimal profile setting leads to reduced effectiveness. Therefore, this study aims to develop a method that optimizes the profile setting of each patient according to the estimated (desired) optimal results. The proposed method is developed using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to cluster patient records into several distinct clusters. K-fold cross validation is applied to construct the prediction models. Classification And Regression Tree (CART) is utilized to predict the patient's optimal input setting for playing the MIRA games. The combination of these techniques seems to improve the efficiency of the standard (default) way in predicting the optimal settings for exergames. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct an experiment with data collected from a rehabilitation center. We use three metrics to quantify the quality of the results: R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results of experimental analysis demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in predicting the adequate parameter setting in MIRA platform. The method has potential to be implemented as an intelligent system for MIRA prediction in healthcare. Moreover, the method could be extended to similar platforms for which data is available to train our method on. © 2021","CART.; Machine learning; MIRA; Rehabilitation; SOM","Algorithms; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Software; Application programs; Conformal mapping; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Mean square error; mHealth; Predictive analytics; Self organizing maps; Supervised learning; Classification and regression tree; Controlled environment; K fold cross validations; Level of difficulties; Rehabilitation exercise; Rehabilitation services; Root mean square errors; Supervised machine learning; adult; analytic method; Article; computer simulation; female; human; k fold cross validation; male; medical interactive rehabilitation assistant; parameters; physiotherapist; process optimization; rehabilitation center; supervised machine learning; telerehabilitation; unsupervised machine learning; virtual reality; algorithm; exercise; kinesiotherapy; software; Patient rehabilitation","W.

However, the most challenging task in predictive modeling is to construct a prediction model, which can be addressed using machine learning (ML) methods. The methods are used to learn and trained the model using a gene expression dataset without being programmed explicitly. Due to the vast amount of gene expression data, this task becomes complex and time consuming. This paper provides a recent review on recent progress in ML and deep learning (DL) for cancer classification, which has received increasing attention in bioinformatics and computational biology. The development of cancer classification methods based on ML and DL is mostly focused on this review. Although many methods have been applied to the cancer classification problem, recent progress shows that most of the successful techniques are those based on supervised and DL methods. In addition, the sources of the healthcare dataset are also described. The development of many machine learning methods for insight analysis in cancer classification has brought a lot of improvement in healthcare. Currently, it seems that there is highly demanded further development of efficient classification methods to address the expansion of healthcare applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: An observational, retrospective, multi-center study that included hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in three hospitals in Colombia. Eight strategies were applied to select prognostic-related characteristics. Eight logistic regression models were built from each set of variables and the predictive ability of the outcome was evaluated. The primary endpoint was transfer to intensive care or in-hospital death. Results: The database consisted of 969 patients of which 486 had complete data. The main outcome occurred in 169 cases. The development database included 220 patients, 137 (62.3%) were men with a median age of 58.2, 39 (17.7%) were diabetic, 62 (28.2%) had high blood pressure, and 32 (14.5%) had chronic lung disease. Thirty-three variables were identified as prognostic markers, and those selected most frequently were: LDH, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, CRP, age, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, ferritin, and HCO3. The eight logistic regressions developed were validated on 266 patients in whom similar results were reached (accuracy: 65.8-72.9%). Conclusions: The combined use of strategies for selecting characteristics through machine learning techniques makes it possible to identify a broad set of prognostic markers in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 for death or hospitalization in intensive care.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","COVID-19; feature selection; machine learning; prognostic; risk factors","adult; aged; algorithm; Article; breathing rate; chronic lung disease; clinical assessment; clinical feature; Colombia; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; death; decision tree; demographics; diabetes mellitus; dyspnea; feature selection; female; fever; genetic algorithm; Horowitz index; hospital admission; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; hypertension; in-hospital mortality; intensive care unit; laboratory test; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; lung infiltrate; lymphocyte; lymphocyte count; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; multivariate logistic regression analysis; neutrophil; outcome assessment; oxygen saturation; prognosis; prognostic assessment; real time polymerase chain reaction; recursive feature selection; recursive partitioning; retrospective study; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; simulated annealing; stochastic gradient boosting; symptom; thorax radiography; validation process; virus pneumonia; vital sign","S.D.

Under the trend of wide application of deep learning algorithms, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is modified to build an interactive smart healthcare prediction and evaluation model (SHPE model) based on the deep learning model. The model is optimized and standardized for data processing. Then, the constructed model is simulated to analyze its performance. The results show that accuracy of the constructed system reaches 82.4%, which is at least 2.4% higher than other advanced CNN algorithms and 3.3% higher than other classical machine algorithms. It is proved based on comparison that the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 of the constructed model are the highest. Further analysis on error shows that the constructed model shows the smallest error of 23.34 pixels. Therefore, it is proved that the built SHPE model shows higher prediction accuracy and smaller error while ensuring the safety performance, which provides an experimental reference for the prediction and evaluation of smart healthcare treatment in the later stage.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Healthcare prediction and evaluation model; Precision; Smart healthcare","Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Deep neural networks; Errors; Forecasting; Health care; Iron alloys; Multimedia systems; Component structure; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Evaluation models; Healthcare prediction and evaluation model; Interactive multimedia; Permalloys; Precision; Prediction modelling; Smart healthcare; Convolution","","","Association for Computing Machinery","15516857","","","","English","ACM Trans.

The clinical features between stroke patients with good and with poor outcomes were compared using three different machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) to identify which performed best. Two datasets from the other stroke center were included accordingly for external verification and performed with explainable AI models. Results: Of the 488 patients enrolled in this study, and 374 (76.6%) patients had favorable outcomes. Patients with higher mRs at 3 months had increased systolic pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol (TC), and 7-day National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score compared to those with lower mRs. The predictability and the areas under the curves (AUC) for the random forest model was relatively higher than support vector machine and LR models. These findings were further validated in the external dataset and similar results were obtained. The explainable AI model identified the risk factors as well. Conclusion: Explainable AI model is able to identify NIHSS_Day7 is independently efficient in predicting neurological outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke after intravenous thrombolysis.

It is observed that most of the attention has centred on applying ML for dvsetecting AF, particularly using electrocardiograms (ECGs) as the main data modality. Nearly a third of them used DeepNNs to minimize or eliminate the need for transforming the ECGs to extract features prior to ML modelling; however, we did not observe a significant advantage in following this approach. We also found a fraction of studies using other data modalities, and others centred in aims, such as risk prediction, AF management, and others. From the clinical perspective, AI/ML can help expand the utility of AF detection and risk prediction, especially for patients with additional comorbidities. The use of AI/ML for detection and risk prediction into applications and smart mobile health (mHealth) technology would enable 'real time' dynamic assessments. AI/ML could also adapt to treatment changes over time, as well as incident risk factors. Incorporation of a dynamic AI/ML model into mHealth technology would facilitate 'real time' assessment of stroke risk, facilitating mitigation of modifiable risk factors (e.g. blood pressure control). Overall, this would lead to an improvement in clinical care for patients with AF.  © 2021 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved.

But the current research has not combined these factors to predict the subsidence, there is a lack of an individualized and comprehensive evaluation of the risk of cage subsidence following the surgery. So we attempt to identify potential risk factors and develop a risk prediction model that can predict the possibility of subsidence by providing a Cage Subsidence Score (CSS) after surgery, and evaluate whether machine learning-related techniques can effectively predict the subsidence. Methods: This study reviewed 59 patients who underwent posterior lumbar fusion in our hospital from 2014 to 2019. They were divided into a subsidence group and a non-subsidence group according to whether the interbody fusion cage subsidence occurred during follow-up. Data were collected on the patient, including age, sex, cage segment, number of fusion segments, preoperative space height, postoperative space height, preoperative L4 lordosis Angle, postoperative L4 lordosis Angle, preoperative L5 lordosis Angle, postoperative PT, postoperative SS, postoperative PI. The conventional statistical analysis method was used to find potential risk factors that can lead to subsidence, then the results were incorporated into stepwise regression and machine learning algorithms, respectively, to build a model that could predict the subsidence. Finally the diagnostic efficiency of prediction is verified. Results: Univariate analysis showed significant differences in pre−/postoperative intervertebral disc height, postoperative L4 segment lordosis, postoperative PT, and postoperative SS between the subsidence group and the non-subsidence group (p < 0.05). The CSS was trained by stepwise regression: 2 points for postoperative disc height > 14.68 mm, 3 points for postoperative L4 segment lordosis angle >16.91°, and 4 points for postoperative PT > 22.69°. If the total score is larger than 0.5, it is the high-risk subsidence group, while less than 0.5 is low-risk. The score obtains the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.857 and 0.806 in the development and validation set, respectively. The AUC of the GBM model based on the machine learning algorithm to predict the risk in the training set is 0.971 and the validation set is 0.889. The AUC of the avNNet model reached 0.931 in the training set and 0.868 in the validation set, respectively. Conclusion: The machine learning algorithm has advantages in some indicators, and we have preliminarily established a CSS that can predict the risk of postoperative subsidence after lumbar fusion and confirmed the important application prospect of machine learning in solving practical clinical problems.

In past years, it was supposed that only doctors and medical practitioners should handle the decisions in healthcare systems. With the rise of machine learning, the tables have turned and dependency on algorithms to make support systems for healthcare has increased. Various AI predictive models have been built for the prediction of diseases at an early stage. Not only this, but data science is also used in a lot of areas of healthcare ranging from summarization of clinical data to intelligent predictive models. However, the work in developing a decision-support system for healthcare is still in the infancy state. Most of the conventional decision-support systems are based on hard computing which requires exactly state analytic models and does not have any place for approximation and uncertainty. Soft computing, being an approach that imitates the human mind to reason and learns in an environment of uncertainty and impression, helps to provide an optimal solution through its nature of adaptivity and knowledge. Various studies have shown that models which exten-sively used soft computing methodologies, for example, fuzzy logic, ANN, Genetic Algorithms, etc. were able to present clinical observations and inferences in a way that better helped doctors in decision making. There are various applications in the medical field like summarization of clinical text, activity monitoring, development of adaptive disease management systems where soft computing can be used. The book chapter can discuss the prevailing practices, comparative analysis of the neces-sity of soft computing over more prevalent hard computing techniques, and future directions for the application of soft computing in the healthcare decision-support system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Artificial neural networks; Computer-aided diagnosis; Fuzzy logic; Health care systems; Probabilistic reasoning; Soft-computing","Computer aided diagnosis; Computer circuits; Decision making; Deep learning; Diseases; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Health care; Fuzzy-Logic; Hard computing; Healthcare systems; Medical prognosis; Medical treatment; Predictive models; Probabilistic reasoning; Soft-Computing; Softcomputing techniques; Uncertainty; Soft computing","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","21976503","","","","English","Stud.

There is an increase in research for advanced AI techniques, such as deep learning, to build predictive models for the early detection of diseases. Such predictive models leverage mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable sensors and smartphones to discover novel ways for detecting and managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions. Objective: Currently, little is known about the use of AI-powered mHealth (AIM) settings. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map current research on the emerging use of AIM for managing diseases and promoting health. Our objective is to synthesize research in AIM models that have increasingly been used for health care delivery in the last 2 years. Methods: Using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-point framework for conducting scoping reviews, we reviewed AIM literature from the past 2 years in the fields of biomedical technology, AI, and information systems. We searched 3 databases, PubsOnline at INFORMS, e-journal archive at MIS Quarterly, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library using keywords such as ""mobile healthcare,"" ""wearable medical sensors,"" ""smartphones"", and ""AI."" We included AIM articles and excluded technical articles focused only on AI models. We also used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) technique for identifying articles that represent a comprehensive view of current research in the AIM domain. Results: We screened 108 articles focusing on developing AIM models for ensuring better health care delivery, detecting diseases early, and diagnosing chronic health conditions, and 37 articles were eligible for inclusion, with 31 of the 37 articles being published last year (76%). Of the included articles, 9 studied AI models to detect serious mental health issues, such as depression and suicidal tendencies, and chronic health conditions, such as sleep apnea and diabetes. Several articles discussed the application of AIM models for remote patient monitoring and disease management. The considered primary health concerns belonged to 3 categories: mental health, physical health, and health promotion and wellness. Moreover, 14 of the 37 articles used AIM applications to research physical health, representing 38% of the total studies. Finally, 28 out of the 37 (76%) studies used proprietary data sets rather than public data sets. We found a lack of research in addressing chronic mental health issues and a lack of publicly available data sets for AIM research. Conclusions: The application of AIM models for disease detection and management is a growing research domain. These models provide accurate predictions for enabling preventive care on a broader scale in the health care domain. Given the ever-increasing need for remote disease management during the pandemic, recent AI techniques, such as federated learning and explainable AI, can act as a catalyst for increasing the adoption of AIM and enabling secure data sharing across the health care industry. © 2022 JMIR Publications.

Precision medicine is a growing area in medical science research. By definition precision medicine is an approach that allows the selection of treatments that are most likely to help treat patients based on the genetic understanding of their diseases. This approach proposes the customization of a medical model for healthcare, treatment, medical decision making about genetic diseases and develop models that are tailored to individual patient. There are readily available datasets provided by Genomics England related to diseases and the genes that cause these diseases. This research presents a predictive technique that scores the possibilities of a mutated gene causing a neurological phenotype. There are over a thousand genes associated with 26 subtypes of neurological diseases as defined by Genomics England capturing genetic variation, gene structure and co-expression network. The gene prediction was performed with search algorithms and methods that sequentially looped through the database for true match. Linear search algorithm was applied along index search method to perform the prediction matching of gene(s) that are associated to the disease(s). The prediction algorithm was formulated based on a Mathematical/probabilistic concept that was used to design the model for processing the data-set ready for gene prediction. It became apparent that over half a million (> 500,000) genes were predicted in this study that were associated to the neurological phenotype of the diseases in this research work.

Advances in medical imaging modalities and technologies have greatly aided in the early detection of breast cancer and the decline of patient mortality rates. However, reading and interpreting breast images remains difficult due to the high heterogeneity of breast tumors and fibro-glandular tissue, which results in lower cancer detection sensitivity and specificity and large inter-reader variability. In order to help overcome these clinical challenges, researchers have made great efforts to develop computer-aided detection and/or diagnosis (CAD) schemes of breast images to provide radiologists with decision-making support tools. Recent rapid advances in high throughput data analysis methods and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly radiomics and deep learning techniques, have led to an exponential increase in the development of new AI-based models of breast images that cover a broad range of application topics. In this review paper, we focus on reviewing recent advances in better understanding the association between radiomics features and tumor microenvironment and the progress in developing new AI-based quantitative image feature analysis models in three realms of breast cancer: predicting breast cancer risk, the likelihood of tumor malignancy, and tumor response to treatment. The outlook and three major challenges of applying new AI-based models of breast images to clinical practice are also discussed. Through this review we conclude that although developing new AI-based models of breast images has achieved significant progress and promising results, several obstacles to applying these new AI-based models to clinical practice remain. Therefore, more research effort is needed in future studies.

A retrospective cohort study design was employed to develop and validate a top-performing clinical feature panel accessibly in the electronic medical records (EMRs), which was in the mode of a quantifiable nomogram. Clinical factors regarding demographics, admission cause, clinical laboratory index, medical history and nursing scales were extracted as risk candidates. The performance improvement was based on the application of the machine learning technique, comprising logistic regression, decision tree and random forest algorithm with five-fold cross-validation (CV) technique. The comprehensive assessment of sensitivity, specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was considered in the evaluation of predictive performance. The receiver operating characteristic curves revealed the top performance for the logistic regression model in respect to machine learning improvement, achieving the highest sensitivity and AUC among three types of classifiers. Compared against the 23-point Braden scale routinely recorded online, an incorporated nomogram of logistic regression model and Braden scale achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.87 ± 0.07 and 0.84 ± 0.05 in training and test cohort, respectively. Our findings suggest that the machine learning technique potentiated the limited predictive validity of routinely recorded clinical data on pressure injury development during ICU hospitalisation. Easily accessible electronic records held the potentials to substitute the traditional Braden score in the prediction of pressure injury in intensive care unit. Preoperative prediction of pressure injury facilitates the exemption from the severe consequences. © 2022 The Authors.

Multiple applications for this technology exist for the study of adrenocortical tumors. Taking advantage of the capacity of malignant cortical tumor secretion of non-bioactive precursors, it provides an additional diagnostic approach that can point to the nature of a tumor. These encouraging perspectives have been based to date only on pilot retrospective studies. However, this has changed in 2020 with the publication of data from the EURINE-ACT study. This very large prospective European study provided more nuanced evidence for the benefit of combining the measurement of a panel of steroids with essential imaging tools. This study also facilitated our understanding and provided more precise characterisation of autonomous steroid secretion, particularly in the case of sublinical cortisol-secreting adrenocortical adenomas. This article will focus on our current knowledge on the potential utility of mass spectrometry for diagnosis of both the nature of an adrenal tumors and their secretion. © 2020","Adrenal steroids; Adrenal tumors; Adrenocortical carcinoma; Autonomous cortisol secreting adenoma; Machine learning; Mass spectrometry","Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Artificial Intelligence; Chromatography, Liquid; Diagnostic Techniques, Endocrine; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Medical Oncology; Metabolomics; Steroids; aldosterone synthase; antihypertensive agent; cortodoxone; deoxycorticosterone; dexamethasone; fluorodeoxyglucose; metyrapone; osilodrostat; steroid; tetrahydro 11 deoxycortisol; transcortin; unclassified drug; steroid; adrenal cortex adenoma; adrenal cortex carcinoma; adrenal incidentaloma; Article; artificial intelligence; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; computer assisted tomography; Cushing syndrome; false positive result; high risk patient; human; hydrocortisone blood level; hydrocortisone urine level; hypertension; immunohistochemistry; incidence; intermediate risk patient; liquid chromatography; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; measurement precision; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overnight dexamethasone suppression test; positron emission tomography; predictive value; prevalence; primary hyperaldosteronism; protein expression; receiver operating characteristic; saliva level; sensitivity and specificity; steroid analysis; steroid release; tumor volume; adrenal tumor; endocrine system examination; mass spectrometry; metabolism; metabolomics; oncology; procedures","S.

In the early stages, to evaluate and diagnose the disease of heart failure, cardiac centers and hospitals are heavily based on ECG. The ECG can be considered as a regular tool. Heart disease early detection is a critical concern in healthcare services (HCS). This paper presents the different machine learning technologies based on heart disease detection brief analysis. Firstly, Naïve Bayes with a weighted approach is used for predicting heart disease. The second one, according to the features of frequency domain, time domain, and information theory, is automatic and analyze ischemic heart disease localization/detection. Two classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) with XGBoost with the best performance are selected for the classification in this method. The third one is the heart failure automatic identification method by using an improved SVM based on the duality optimization scheme also analyzed. Finally, for a clinical decision support system (CDSS), an effective heart disease prediction model (HDPM) is used, which includes density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) for outlier detection and elimination, a hybrid synthetic minority over-sampling technique-edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) for balancing the training data distribution, and XGBoost for heart disease prediction. Machine learning can be applied in the medical industry for disease diagnosis, detection, and prediction. The major purpose of this paper is to give clinicians a tool to help them diagnose heart problems early on. As a result, it will be easier to treat patients effectively and avoid serious repercussions. This study uses XGBoost to test alternative decision tree classification algorithms in the hopes of improving the accuracy of heart disease diagnosis. In terms of precision, accuracy, f1-measure, and recall as performance parameters above mentioned, four types of machine learning (ML) models are compared.

Nevertheless, even with outstanding results in some computer vision tasks, there is still much to explore as problems are becoming more complex, or applications are demanding new restrictions that hamper current techniques performance. Several works have been developed throughout the last decade to support automated medical diagnosis, yet detecting neural-based strokes, the so-called cerebrovascular accident (CVA). However, such approaches have room for improvement, such as the employment of information fusion techniques in deep learning architectures. Such an approach might benefit CVA detection as most state-of-the-art models use computer-based tomography and magnetic resonance imaging samples. Therefore, the present work aims at enhancing stroke detection through information fusion, mainly composed of original and Fourier-based samples, applied to shallow architectures (Restricted Boltzmann machines). The whole picture employs multimodal inputs, allowing data from different domains (images and Fourier transforms) to be learned together, improving the model's predictive capacity. As the main result, the proposed approach overpassed the baselines, achieving the remarkable accuracy of 99.72%.  © 2021 IEEE.","Fourier transform; Restricted Boltzmann Machines; Stroke classification","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Information fusion; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Network architecture; 'current; Cerebrovascular accident; Fourier; Learning techniques; Neural-networks; OR applications; Performance; Restricted boltzmann machine; Service-based; Stroke classification; Fourier transforms","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-166542354-0","","","English","Proc. - SIBGRAPI Conf.

These vectors may act as representatives for objects being considered. Similarity measurement thus gains a great importance in the design of machine learning or deep learning algorithms and techniques. In similar lines, when we are required to carry a supervised or unsupervised learning task, an algorithm is required to carry the task efficiently. Thus, in this paper, our objective is to outline various similarity measures that have been considered for carrying supervised or unsupervised learning tasks and also to throw light on different machine learning algorithms employed for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks from disease classification and prediction point of view and also interdisciplinary domains such as time series analysis, temporal data mining, medical data mining, and anomaly or intrusion detection. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We treat the MNAR problem as an imbalanced learning task. Standard predictive error measures of regression (e.g., mean squared error) are not suitable for imbalanced learning problems, such as in clinical trials where extreme values tend to be MNAR. We investigate hybrid imbalanced learning approaches that combine utility-based regression (UBR) with synthetic minority oversampling technique for regression (SMOTER) in cross-sectional trial settings. UBR optimizes the product of the conditional probability density (estimated by quantile regression forests) and a utility function which takes the relevance of the target variable value and the prediction error into account. SMOTER oversamples the relevant rare cases. Simulations show that the proposed method provides plausible predictions and reduces the bias for realistic missing data scenarios when compared with standard approaches like random forests and multiple imputation (systematic bias is observed in those methods, i.e., a tendency to underestimate the mean and standard deviation given the presence of MNAR in the area of high values of the target variable). The proposed method is implemented in a real dataset from an antidepressant clinical trial, and similar pattern of the systematic bias from commonly used methods is observed in the real data compare to the proposed method. Therefore, we encourage the integration of utility-based learning strategies for handling of missing data in the analysis of clinical trials. © 2022","Machine learning; Missing data; SMOTER; Utility-based regression","Bias; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Collection; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Research Design; Data handling; Errors; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Medical applications; Regression analysis; antidepressant agent; Clinical trial; Imbalanced Learning; Machine-learning; Missing data; Missing data imputations; Missing not at random; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Synthetic minority oversampling technique for regression; Systematic bias; Utility-based regression; Article; clinical trial (topic); controlled study; data accuracy; machine learning; outcome variable; prediction; prediction error; probability; random forest; sampling; sensitivity analysis; simulation; statistical bias; target variable; utility value; cross-sectional study; information processing; methodology; procedures; statistical analysis; Decision trees","U.

It was possible to continually accumulate data by generating dummy data for learning by creating a database for the model to systematically learn the 23 types of tests. To determine the consistency of quality control, the critical value for 23 factors that have an impact on the delta check and panic check was analyzed using the random forest algorithm. For performance analysis of the predictive model, accuracy, precision, ROC curve, confusion matrix, and recall were measured and analyzed. This study applied the CatBoost and random forest algorithms for an analysis of the quality control consistency prediction model to obtain sufficient data to train the machine learning algorithms using pre-annotation and data analysis functions for delta check and panic check. The optimized algorithm was learned by applying the LightGBM method to the data that were preprocessed to be suitable for machine learning. To verify the accuracy of the learning results, the test dataset and the empirical dataset were used, and the accuracy of the predictive model was improved through the repetition of machine learning by incorporating the results on quality control consistency in the machine learning model. As a result of analyzing the quality control consistency prediction model, accuracy, ROC curve, precision, F1 score, and recall were all found to be at least 95% or higher, indicating excellence. It is possible to improve the reliability of diagnostic tests by applying an AI-based prediction model to the verification of the consistency of outsourced test results using machine learning techniques.

Thus, in the field of clinical decision making, only the most relevant features from a set of medical descriptors should be considered when determining whether a patient is healthy or not. This statistical approach known as feature selection can be performed through regression or classification, in a supervised or unsupervised manner. Several feature selection approaches using different mathematical concepts have been described in the literature. In the field of classification, a new approach has recently been proposed that uses the γ-metric, an index measuring separability between different classes in heart rhythm characterization. The present study proposes a filter approach for feature selection in classification using this γ-metric, and evaluates its application to automatic atrial fibrillation detection. Methods: The stability and prediction performance of the γ-metric feature selection approach was evaluated using the support vector machine model on two heart rhythm datasets, one extracted from the PhysioNet database and the other from the database of Marseille University Hospital Center, France (Timone Hospital). Both datasets contained electrocardiogram recordings grouped into two classes: normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation. The performance of this feature selection approach was compared to that of three other approaches, with the first two based on the Random Forest technique and the other on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: The γ-metric approach showed satisfactory results, especially for models with a smaller number of features. For the training dataset, all prediction indicators were higher for our approach (accuracy greater than 99% for models with 5 to 17 features), as was stability (greater than 0.925 regardless of the number of features included in the model). For the validation dataset, the features selected with the γ-metric approach differed from those selected with the other approaches; sensitivity was higher for our approach, but other indicators were similar. Conclusion: This filter approach for feature selection in classification opens up new methodological avenues for atrial fibrillation detection using short electrocardiogram recordings. © 2021, The Author(s).","Atrial fibrillation detection; Classification; Clinical decision making; Feature selection; Machine learning; γ-metric","Atrial Fibrillation; Databases, Factual; Electrocardiography; France; Humans; Support Vector Machine; atrial fibrillation; electrocardiography; factual database; France; human; support vector machine","P.

To construct a prediction model, Excel was utilized for data analysis, the processed data was examined using the CatBoost algorithm, and a decision tree analysis algorithm using test factors and demographic components was applied. 69,687 pieces of valid data consisting of twenty-three diagnostic test factors and two demographic factors were obtained and applied to a platform called Hello Datta for big data analysis and machine learning. Feature extraction was performed through dimensional reduction for data normalization, and the pre-annotation function was used for data preprocessing. Following the annotation process, the data were segregated into learning data for the development and application of predictive models, and test data for the predictive model's performance evaluation. A random forest analysis algorithm was used to derive the test items that were important in disease prediction and to analyze the accuracy of the prediction. In the case of performance analysis, the accuracy, ROC area, confusion matrix, precision, and recall were analyzed. First, the model for predicting the presence of hyperlipidemia that was developed in this study was found to have a high prediction accuracy that surpassed 85% and a large AUC. Second, a cluster analysis of the test results that were positive (34%) and negative (66%) for hyperlipidemia showed that the collected data were useful in the predictive model research. Third, in the case of hyperlipidemia, which is strongly associated with blood circulation, it was deemed possible to use the developed model predict other similar diseases. Fourth, it was determined that if the data structure was altered to a format that displayed the test results for time series analysis and the time of disease diagnosis, useful findings might be produced. The diagnosis prediction model developed in this study, which uses big data analysis and machine learning technology, is expected to lead to a digital healthcare service model that combines healthcare data and artificial intelligence technology to reduce diagnostic errors in medical settings and provide prompt disease diagnosis for improved healthcare services. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

These tools are typically employed on medical data (i.e., image, molecular data, clinical variables, etc.) and used the statistical and machine-learning methods to measure the model performance. In this review, we summarized and discussed the most recent radiomic pipeline used for clinical analysis. Recent findings Currently, limited management of cancers benefits from artificial intelligence, mostly related to a computer-aided diagnosis that avoids a biopsy analysis that presents additional risks and costs. Most artificial intelligence tools are based on imaging features, known as radiomic analysis that can be refined into predictive models in noninvasively acquired imaging data. This review explores the progress of artificial intelligence-based radiomic tools for clinical applications with a brief description of necessary technical steps. Explaining new radiomic approaches based on deep-learning techniques will explain how the new radiomic models (deep radiomic analysis) can benefit from deep convolutional neural networks and be applied on limited data sets. Summary To consider the radiomic algorithms, further investigations are recommended to involve deep learning in radiomic models with additional validation steps on various cancer types.

Data mining algorithms are employed to analyze different types of data, which reside in complex information networks. Researchers focus on producing usable knowledge by taking advantage of opportunities in various domains (e.g., healthcare, social media, energy etc.). Epidemics and disease outbreaks raised concerns about effective infectious disease management in communities around the world. Therefore, they encourage the use of AI methods for management and prevention, in order to mitigate disease spread, and contain outbreaks. This work engages in predictive analytics, utilizing classification, as well as descriptive analytics utilizing association rule mining and clustering, which are widely used in healthcare and medicine, either for predicting outbreaks or for extracting usable information from healthcare and medical data. Certain steps need to be considered when attempting to perform data analysis, such as data extraction, cleaning, preprocessing, transformation, interpretation and evaluation. The experimental part of this chapter integrates widely used datasets retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository related with the healthcare domain. This chapter offers a literature review on data mining in epidemics, while thoroughly discussing all the aforementioned concepts. It also presents a complete process/cycle of the required steps to analyze data retrieved from healthcare and medical sources. Hence, the research questions addressed can be summarized to the following: Q1. Which are the pervasive types of analytics involving the domains of medicine and healthcare? Q2. How is data mining performed in the fields of healthcare and medicine? Q3. Which are the widespread techniques and methods utilized?

Purpose: To evaluate the reported performance of stand-alone ML applications for screening mammography workflow. Materials and Methods: Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Web of Science literature databases were searched for relevant studies published from January 2012 to September 2020. The study was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (protocol no. CRD42019156016). Stand-alone technology was defined as a ML algorithm that can be used independently of a human reader. Studies were quality assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, and reporting was evaluated using the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging. A primary meta-analysis included the top-performing algorithm and corresponding reader performance from which pooled summary estimates for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated using a bivariate model. Results: Fourteen articles were included, which detailed 15 studies for stand-alone detection (n = 8) and triage (n = 7). Triage studies reported that 17%-91% of normal mammograms identified could be read by adapted screening, while ""missing""an estimated 0%-7% of cancers. In total, an estimated 185 252 cases from three countries with more than 39 readers were included in the primary meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC was 75.4% (95% CI: 65.6, 83.2; P = .11), 90.6% (95% CI: 82.9, 95.0; P = .40), and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.98), respectively, for algorithms, and 73.0% (95% CI: 60.7, 82.6), 88.6% (95% CI: 72.4, 95.8), and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.97), respectively, for readers. Conclusion: Machine learning (ML) algorithms that demonstrate a stand-alone application in mammographic screening workflows achieve or even exceed human reader detection performance and improve efficiency. However, this evidence is from a small number of retrospective studies. Therefore, further rigorous independent external prospective testing of ML algorithms to assess performance at preassigned thresholds is required to support these claims.  ©RSNA, 2021.","","Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Mammography; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Sensitivity and Specificity; Workflow; breast cancer; cancer screening; data extraction; data quality assessment; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; machine learning; mammography; meta analysis; patient triage; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; Review; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis; systematic review; breast tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; mammography; procedures; workflow","F.J.

A minority of patients (17%) showed clinical symptoms and need a gluten free diet at time of diagnosis, while the majority progress over several years (up to a decade) without any clinical problem neither a progression of the small intestine mucosal damage even when they continued to assume gluten in their diet. Recently we developed a traditional multivariate approach to predict the natural history, on the base of the information at enrolment (time 0) by a discriminant analysis model. Still, the traditional multivariate model requires stringent assumptions that may not be answered in the clinical setting. Starting from a follow-up dataset available for PCD, we propose the application of Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to extend the analysis on available clinical data and to detect most influent features predicting the outcome. These features, collected at time of diagnosis, should be capable to classify patients who will develop duodenal atrophy from those who will remain potential. Four ML methods were adopted to select features predictive of the outcome; the feature selection procedure was indeed capable to reduce the number of overall features from 85 to 19. ML methodologies (Random Forests, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression) were adopted, obtaining high values of accuracy: all report an accuracy above 75%. The specificity score was always more than 75% also, with two of the considered methods over 98%, while the best performance of sensitivity was 60%. The best model, optimized Boosted Trees, was able to classify PCD starting from the selected 19 features with an accuracy of 0.80, sensitivity of 0.58 and specificity of 0.84. Finally, with this work, we are able to categorize PCD patients that can more likely develop overt CD using ML. ML techniques appear to be an innovative approach to predict the outcome of PCD, since they provide a step forward in the direction of precision medicine aimed to customize healthcare, medical therapies, decisions, and practices tailoring the clinical management of PCD children. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Celiac Disease; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Machine Learning; Precision Medicine; Prognosis; celiac disease; follow up; human; machine learning; personalized medicine; prognosis","F.

For the detailed investigation of samples, a high-resolution image with enhanced contrast and minimal damage is preferred. To achieve this, an automated image analysis method is preferable over manual analysis in terms of both speed of acquisition and reduced error accumulation. In this regard, deep learning (DL)-based image processing can be highly beneficial. The review summarises and critiques the use of DL in image processing for the data collected using various optical microscopic techniques. In tandem with optical microscopy, DL has already found applications in various problems related to image classification and segmentation. It has also performed well in enhancing image resolution in smartphone-based microscopy, which in turn enablse crucial medical assistance in remote places.

Thus, there is a need for computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) models for the automatic segmentation and classification of stroke on brain MRI. The heterogeneity of stroke pathogenesis, morphology, image acquisition modalities, sequences, and intralesional tissue signal intensity, as well as lesion-to-normal tissue contrast, pose significant challenges to the development of such systems. Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in predictive neuroimaging diagnosis and prognostication. This paper reviews image processing and machine learning techniques that have been applied to detect ischemic stroke on brain MRI, including details on image acquisition, pre-processing, techniques to segment, extraction of features, and classification into stroke types. The main objective of this work is to find the state-of-art machine learning techniques used to predict the ischemic stroke and their application in clinical set-up. The article selection is performed according to PRISMA guideline. The state-of-the-art on automated MRI stroke diagnosis, with a focus on machine learning, is discussed, along with its advantages and limitations. We found that the various machine learning models discussed in this article are able to detect the infarcts with an acceptable accuracy of 70–90%. However, no one has highlighted the time complexity to predict the stroke in the model developed, which is an important factor. The work concludes with proposals for future recommendations for building efficient and robust deep learning (DL) models for quantitative brain MRI analysis. In recent work, with the application of DL approaches, using large datasets to train the models has improved the detection accuracy and reduced computational complexity. We suggest that the design of a decision support system based on artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical data presenting symptoms is essential to support clinicians to accelerate diagnosis and timeous therapy in the emergency management of stroke. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; brain stroke; computer-aided-diagnosis; decision support system; machine learning; medical imaging","brain infarction; computer assisted diagnosis; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; feature extraction; human; image analysis; image processing; image segmentation; ischemic stroke; machine learning; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; quantitative analysis; Review; systematic review","S.

This study aimed to develop an artificial neural network model that helps to predict the individuals' risk of developing oral cancer based on data on risk factors, systematic medical condition, and clinic-pathological features. Methods: A popular data mining algorithm artificial neural network was used for developing the artificial intelligence-based prediction model. A total of 29 variables that were associated with the patients were used for developing the model. The dataset was randomly split into the training dataset 54 (75%) cases and testing dataset 19 (25%) cases. All records and observations were reviewed by Board-certified oral pathologist. Results: A total of 73 patients met the eligibility criteria. Twenty-two (30.13%) were benign cases, and 51 (69.86%) were malignant cases. Thirty-seven were female, and 36 were male, with a mean age of 63.09 years. Our analysis displayed that the average sensitivity and specificity of ANN for oral cancer prediction based on the 10-fold cross-validation analysis was 85.71% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57.19-98.22) and 60.00% (95% CI, 14.66-94.73), respectively. The accuracy of ANN for oral cancer prediction was 78.95% (95% CI, 54.43-931.95). Conclusion: Our results suggest that this machine-learning technique has the potential to help in oral cancer screening and diagnosis based on the datasets. The results demonstrate that the artificial neural network could perform well in estimating the probability of malignancy and improve the positive predictive value that could help to predict the individuals' risk of developing OC based on knowledge of their risk factors, systemic medical conditions, and clinic-pathological data. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Developing prognostic models is one of the applications of predictive analytics in medical environments. Various studies have used machine learning techniques for this purpose. However, there is no specific standard for choosing prediction models for different medical purposes. In this paper, the ISAF framework was proposed for choosing appropriate prediction models with regard to the properties of the classification methods. As one of the case study applications, a prognostic model for predicting cardiac arrests in sepsis patients was developed step by step through the ISAF framework. Finally, a new modified stacking model produced the best results. We predict 85 % of heart arrest cases one hour before the incidence (sensitivity> = 0.85) and 73 % of arrest cases 25 h before the occurrence (sensitivity> = 0.73). The results indicated that the proposed prognostic model has significantly improved the prediction results compared to the two standard systems of APACHE II and MEWS. Furthermore, compared to previous research, the proposed model has extended the prediction interval and improved the performance criteria. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Early prediction; Ensemble deep learning; Layered approach; Machine learning","Delivery of Health Care; Heart Arrest; Humans; Machine Learning; Sepsis; Decision making; Forecasting; Health care; Learning systems; Classification methods; Machine learning techniques; Performance criterion; Personalized healthcare; Prediction interval; Prediction model; Prognostic model; Stacking models; Article; classification algorithm; clinical feature; comparative study; data processing; health care; heart arrest; human; machine learning; predictive value; priority journal; prognosis; sensitivity analysis; sepsis; health care delivery; heart arrest; machine learning; sepsis; Predictive analytics","M.M.

In this study, a two-channel data acquisition system for measuring EMG signals is proposed for human lower limb activity recognition. Five leg activities have been accomplished to measure EMG signals from two lower limb muscles to validate the developed hardware. Five subjects (three males and two females) were chosen to acquire EMG signals during these activities. The raw EMG signal was first denoised using a hybrid of Wavelet Decomposition with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (WD-EEMD) approach to classify the recorded EMG dataset. Then, eight time-domain (TD) features were extracted using the overlapping windowing technique. An investigation into the comparative effectiveness of several classifiers is presented, although it was hard to distinguish how the classifiers predicted the activities. Having a trustworthy explanation for the outcomes of these classifiers would be quite beneficial overall. An approach known as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) was introduced to produce trustworthy predictive modeling results and applied the XAI technique known as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to a straightforward human interpretation. LIME investigates how extracted features are anticipated and which features are most responsible for each action. The accuracy of the extra tree classifier gives the highest accuracy of the other studied algorithms for identifying different human lower limb activities from sEMG signals.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Electromyography (EMG) signal acquisition system; explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME); lower limb activity recognition; machine learning (ML); signal processing","Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Data acquisition; Electromyography; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Lime; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Pattern recognition; Time domain analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Wearable sensors; Acquisition systems; Activity recognition; Electromyography signal acquisition system; Electromyography signals; Explainable AI; Features extraction; Hardware; Legged locomotion; Local interpretable model-agnostic explanation; Low limb activity recognition; Lower limb; Machine-learning; Signal acquisitions; Signal-processing; Muscle","A.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence can combine client, temporal, and locational attributes to identify which clients are at greatest risk of loss to follow-up (LTFU) and enable health providers to direct support interventions accordingly.Setting:The analysis was part of a project funded by U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and United States Agency for International Development, Data for Implementation, and applied to data from publicly available sources (health facility data, geospatial data, and satellite imagery) and de-identified electronic medical record data on antiretroviral therapy clients in Nigeria and Mozambique.Methods:The project applied binary classification techniques using temporal cross-validation to predict the risk that patients would be LTFU. Classifiers included logistic regression, neural networks, and tree-based models.Results:Models showed strong predictive power in both settings. In Mozambique, the best-performing model, a Random Forest, achieved an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.65 compared against an underlying LTFU rate of 23%. In Nigeria, the best-performing model, a boosted tree, achieved an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.52 compared against an underlying LTFU rate of 27%.Conclusions:Machine-learned models outperformed current classification techniques and showed potential to better direct health worker resources toward patients at greatest risk of LTFU. Moreover, models performed equally across sex and age groups, supporting the model's generalizability and wider application. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Many studies have been conducted to show that if we have sufficient high amount of data, even simple models perform with great accuracy when used at very complex tasks. Having more data, both in terms of examples or more features, is fortunate. The availability of data enables more better insights and applications. More data indeed enables better approaches. Researchers in field of medical sciences require abundance of data to make intelligent models for disease classification. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) provides a way to generate data in order to tackle the above problems. In this paper, we explain an approach to generate synthetic data using machine learning techniques and correlation coefficients. In this study, we used Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the predictive relationship among the independent variables. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was created and deployed to generate data based on the relationship coming out from the correlation coefficients among the independent variables and also with dependent variables. The approach was tested on Boston House Price Dataset to generate synthetic data for different attributes. Also, to study the appropriateness and cogency of the generated data, we conducted comparison of two models in which one was fed with the real data, and the other model was trained on real and synthetic data. The study showed an improvement in accuracy and generalization on new training instances in the model trained with additional synthetic data. The results conclude that the generated data from the neural networks has sufficient efficacy which can be used for various purposes including data analysis and statistics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Data generation; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Neural networks; Pearson correlation coefficient; Synthetic data","Correlation methods; Generative adversarial networks; Correlation coefficient; Data generation; Independent variables; Machine learning models; Neural-networks; Pearson correlation coefficients; Robust performance; Sample data; Synthetic data; Synthetic data generations; Neural networks","M.

Its early detection is key for a good prognosis and even curative surgery. However, current medical examination methods and tests have been inefficient in detecting ovarian cancer at the early stage, leading to preventable death. So far, new screening tests based on molecular biomarker analysis techniques have not resulted in any substantial improvement in early-stage diagnosis and increased survival. Thus, whilst there remains clear potential to improve outcomes through early detection, novel approaches are needed. Here, we postulated that MALDI-ToF-mass-spectrometry-based tests can be a solution for effective screening of ovarian cancer. In this retrospective cohort study, we generated and analyzed the mass spectra of 181 serum samples of women with and without ovarian cancer. Using bioinformatics pipelines for analysis, including predictive modeling and machine learning, we found distinct mass spectral patterns composed of 9–20 key combinations of peak intensity or peak enrichment features for each stage of ovarian cancer. Based on a scoring algorithm and obtained patterns, the optimal sensitivity for detecting each stage of cancer was 95–97% with a specificity of 97%. Scoring all algorithms simultaneously could detect all stages of ovarian cancer at 99% sensitivity and 92% specificity. The results further demonstrate that the matrix and mass range analyzed played a key role in improving the mass spectral data quality and diagnostic power. Altogether, with the results reported here and increasing evidence of the MS assay’s diagnostic accuracy and instrument robustness, it has become imminent to consider MS in the clinical application for ovarian cancer screening. © 2022 by the authors.

PPPM principles can be applied to all medical domains. To this aim, PPPM can use methodologies, techniques, and tools provided by any other discipline, such as mathematics or engineering. Among them, one of the most promising is computer science, particularly artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the new paradigm that will change how many of the tasks currently done by humans will be done shortly. This potential has been envisioned by World Health Organization that has deposited great expectations on how artificial intelligence will improve health care provisioning. This chapter illustrates the application of PPPM principles to early bacteraemia prediction using machine learning techniques. Bacteraemia can produce severe sepsis, one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality, and its prognosis depends on a rapid diagnosis and an appropriate antibiotic treatment. Currently, the bacteraemia diagnosis is based on laboratory tests that can take up to 6 days. An early prediction based on machine learning techniques using electronic health records of hospital patients along with the physician analysis of patient variables would shorten up to 6 days the start of early administration of personalised antibiotics and additional treatments that would prevent subsequent complications. The chapter summarises the current approach to treating bacteraemia, its deficits and its clinical, economic, and structural consequences. Afterwards, it presents all the steps to apply machine learning of hospital records: cleaning the data, detecting bias, handling missing data, and applying machine learning techniques. Data have been analysed using three machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbours. The machine learning techniques provide state-of-the-art results in metrics of interest in predictive medical models with values that exceed the medical practice threshold and previous results in the literature using classical modelling techniques in specific types of bacteraemia. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Bacteraemia; Bid data analysis; Expert recommendations; Machine learning; Modelling; Predictive preventive personalised medicine (PPPM/3 PM)","colistin; steroid; accuracy; algorithm; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; bacteremia; bioinformatics; blood culture; cholangitis; cholecystitis; controlled study; data analysis; decision tree; diagnostic test accuracy study; electronic health record; entropy; expectation; fever; hospital cost; hospital patient; human; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; medical practice; morbidity; mouth hygiene; osteomyelitis; periodontal disease; personalized medicine; physician; predictive value; prostatitis; random forest; sensitivity and specificity; skin flora","O.

Previous studies on occupancy prediction have focused primarily on adult healthcare settings, we sought to develop occupancy prediction models specifically tailored to the needs and characteristics of paediatric surgical settings. Materials and methods We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study at a surgical unit in a tertiary-care paediatric hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. We developed a hierarchical modelling framework for predicting next-day census using multiple types of data - from bottom-up patient-specific orders and procedures to top-down temporal variables and departmental admission statistics. Results: The model predicted upcoming admissions and discharges with a median error of 17%-21% (2-3 patients per day), and next-day census with a median error of 7% (n=3). The primary factors driving these predictions included day of week and scheduled surgeries, as well as procedure duration, procedure type and days since admission. We found that paediatric surgical procedure duration was highly predictive of postoperative length of stay. Discussion Our hierarchical modelling framework provides an overview of the factors driving capacity issues in the paediatric surgical unit, highlighting the importance of both top-down temporal features (eg, day of week) as well as bottom-up electronic health records (EHR)derived features (eg, orders for patient) for predicting next-day census. In the practice, this framework can be implemented stepwise, from top to bottom, making it easier to adopt. Conclusion: Modelling frameworks combining top-down and bottom-up features can provide accurate predictions of next-day census in a paediatric surgical setting.  © 2022 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","general surgery; machine learning; medical informatics applications","adult; article; case report; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; electronic health record; female; general surgery; human; length of stay; machine learning; male; Massachusetts; medical informatics; pediatric hospital; pilot study; prediction; retrospective study; surgical technique; surgical ward; tertiary health care","Y.

We attain this goal by creating a mobile application that analyses patient's medical records, such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney diseases. Then, we implement the system to diagnose patients with chronic conditions using machine learning techniques. Machine learning classifiers are used in this paper to decide whether a person has any chronic diseases. The investigated diseases are hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Four datasets were used to build the classifying models. Orange3 from Anaconda-Navigator, a data mining tool, was used to test machine learning algorithms. The study findings revealed the superiority of the tree algorithm with 100% accuracy for hypertension; it was the highest outcome for both males and females using Orange3. The highest precision, which is 100%, is observed by SVM, k-NN, decision trees, logistic regression, and CART for hypertension males’ data collection. In comparison, the highest precision is 100% in SVM, MLP, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and CART for the female dataset. We conclude that the two datasets for the same diseases share mostly the same algorithm accuracy. For kidneys, the Random Forest algorithm produced 100% accuracy, which is the highest value among other algorithms. For diabetes, neural networks have attested the best accuracy. It was 76.3%, yet the accuracy increased slightly as the kNN algorithm showed 83% accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chronic diseases; Chronic kidney diseases; Classification; Data mining; Diabetes; Feature selection methods; Hypertension; Machine learning techniques","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Data mining; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Random forests; Support vector machines; Chronic disease; Chronic kidney disease; Disease diagnosis; Disease monitoring; Feature selection methods; High-precision; Hypertension; Logistics regressions; Machine learning techniques; Monitoring system; Diseases","S.A.

Still, clinical data privacy concerns a lot, limiting the revolution in the clinical care industry. Patient’s clinical information is exceptionally subtle and personally identifiable, like medical history, ongoing conditions, payment and credit card information; due to these private data, regulations like Health Insurance Portability and Accountability heavily protect patient’s medical data. Here synthetic patient data artificially generated can be the best solution to tackle the challenges of health care transformation. Researchers, medical institutes, and companies building artificial intelligence solutions always need clinical data to work upon so synthetic data can help them eliminate the above challenges. In this proposal, weighted bayesian association rules concepts are applied to generate realistic synthetic data while preserving the relationships among the data and validating the synthetic information using the multivariate relationships method and predictive techniques. University of California Irvine datasets of heart disease, breast cancer, and diabetes are used to generate synthetic datasets to build weighted Bayesian belief networks with promising results. The proposed idea will allow healthcare organizations to efficiently distribute synthetic clinical data to researchers, develop inferences, and create analytical tools without compromising data privacy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.","Bayesian networks; Health data; Multivariate analysis; Synthetic data generation; Weighted concept","","S.

Mindfulness meditation has been associated with significant improvements in pain, depression, physical and mental health, sleep, and overall quality of life. Group medical visits are increasingly common and are effective at treating myriad illnesses, including chronic pain. Integrative Medical Group Visits (IMGV) combine mindfulness techniques, evidence based integrative medicine, and medical group visits and can be used as adjuncts to medications, particularly in diverse underserved populations with limited access to non-pharmacological therapies. Objective and Design: The objective of the present study was to use a blended analytical approach of machine learning and regression analyses to evaluate the potential relationship between depression and chronic pain in data from a randomized clinical trial of IMGV in diverse, income-disadvantaged patients suffering from chronic pain and depression. Methods: The analytical approach used machine learning to assess the predictive relationship between depression and pain and identify and select key mediators, which were then assessed with regression analyses. It was hypothesized that depression would predict the pain outcomes of average pain, pain severity, and pain interference. Results: Our analyses identified and characterized a predictive relationship between depression and chronic pain interference. This prediction was mediated by high perceived stress, low pain self-efficacy, and poor sleep quality, potential targets for attenuating the adverse effects of depression on functional outcomes. Conclusions: In the context of the associated clinical trial and similar interventions, these insights may inform future treatment optimization, targeting, and application efforts in racialized, income-disadvantaged populations, demographics often neglected in studies of chronic pain.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Chronic Pain; Depression; Pain Interference; Self-Efficacy; Sleep; Stress","Adult; Chronic Pain; Depression; Humans; Mindfulness; Quality of Life; Vulnerable Populations; adult; aged; Article; chronic pain; clinical outcome; clinical study; controlled study; data analysis; demographics; depression; disadvantaged population; disease association; female; hierarchical linear regression analysis; human; income; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; linear regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mental stress; middle aged; pain assessment; pain interference; pain severity; prediction; race difference; random forest; randomized controlled trial; self concept; sleep; sleep quality; very elderly; chronic pain; complication; depression; mindfulness; procedures; psychology; quality of life; vulnerable population","P.

In addition, computing and the modern technologies are not really coexisting anymore. With a wide range of conditions and areas of concern, the medical domain was also concerned. New types of technologies, such as context-aware systems and applications, are constantly being infused into the medicine field. An IoT-enabled healthcare system based on context awareness is developed in this work. In order to collect and store the patient data, smart medical devices are employed. Context-aware data from the database includes the patient's medical records and personal information. The MRIPPER (Modified Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error) technique is used to analyze and classify the data. A rule-based machine learning method is used in this algorithm. The rules for analyzing datasets in order to make predictions about heart disease are framed using this algorithm. MATLAB is used to simulate the proposed model's performance analysis. Other models like random forest, J48, CART, JRip, and OneR algorithms are also compared to validate the proposed model's performance. The proposed model obtains 98.89 percent accuracy, 96.76 percent precision, 99.05 percent sensitivity, 94.35 percent specificity, and 97.60 percent f-score. Predictions for subjects in the normal and abnormal classes were both accurate with 97.38 for normal and 97.93 for abnormal subjects. © 2022 Saad Almutairi et al.","","Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Heart Diseases; Humans; Machine Learning; Cardiology; Decision trees; Diseases; Hospital data processing; Machine learning; MATLAB; Ubiquitous computing; User interfaces; Areas of concerns; Condition; Context-Aware; Daily lives; Error algorithms; Heart disease; Medical domains; Mobile computing devices; Modeling performance; Modern technologies; adult; Article; awareness; classification algorithm; clinical article; comparative study; context effect; data analysis software; health care system; heart disease; human; identifiable information; machine learning; male; medical record; methodology; modified repeated incremental pruning to produce error; predictive value; random forest; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; factual database; Forecasting","S.

Recently, the application of artificial intelligence, including machine learning (ML), has expanded into the stroke medical field, which could clarify the factors affecting toileting independence in severe stroke patients. This study aimed to identify the factors affecting toileting independence in severe stroke patients using ML. Methods: We used the Japan Rehabilitation Database from 2005 to 2015 to investigate data from 2292 severe stroke patients. We performed the chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) algorithm with various explanatory variables. Results: The CHAID model identified modified Rankin scale (mRS) score as the first discriminator. Among those with an mRS score ≤4, the next discriminator was age (score ≤72, 73–80, or >80). Among those with an mRS score > 4, the next discriminator was also age (score ≤57, 58–72, 73–80, or >80). Interestingly, some patients achieved toileting independence, although this study focused on severe stroke patients. In branches based on age, the percentage of the patients who achieved toileting independence at discharge decreased progressively with age. Conclusion: We identified the influential factors, including reference values, for achieving toileting independence in convalescent severe stroke patients. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Clinical feature; Decision tree; Severe stroke; Toileting ability","Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Convalescence; Databases, Factual; Decision Support Techniques; Decision Trees; Defecation; Disability Evaluation; Female; Functional Status; Humans; Inpatients; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Recovery of Function; Severity of Illness Index; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Urination; adult; article; clinical feature; convalescence; decision tree; detection algorithm; explanatory variable; female; hospital patient; human; Japan; major clinical study; male; Rankin scale; reference value; rehabilitation; stroke patient; toileting; age; aged; algorithm; cerebrovascular accident; decision support system; defecation; disability; factual database; functional status; Japan; micturition; middle aged; pathophysiology; predictive value; severity of illness index; stroke rehabilitation; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly","T.

For instance, any mutation affecting the splice site will lead to genetic diseases and cancer such as Lynch syndrome and breast cancer. For this purpose, collecting the Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) samples is an efficient and convenient method to detect the involvement of splicing defects in disease formation. Therefore, the present study aims to develop an accurate and robust Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) method for swift and precise targeting of splice site sequences. A composite features-based model is proposed by integrating three different sample representation methods i.e., Dinucleotide Composition (DNC), Trinucleotide Composition (TNC) and Tetranucleotide Composition (TetraNC) for precise splice site prediction after converting the DNA sequences into numerical descriptors. The precision and accuracy of these features are analyzed by applying different machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naïve Bayes (NB). Results show that the proposed model of composite features vector with SVM classifier achieved an accuracy of 95.20% and 97.50% for donor and acceptor sites datasets, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Big data analysis; Biomedical data; Computer-aided diagnosis; Genomics; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Splicing sites","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Diseases; DNA sequences; Forecasting; Genes; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Nucleotides; Numerical methods; Predictive analytics; RNA; Sodium compounds; Support vector machines; Composite features; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Donor and acceptor; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Machine learning techniques; Representation method; Splice Site Prediction; Trinucleotide compositions; Learning algorithms","K.

According to a survey, in 1990, the total number of hip fractures in men and women worldwide was approximately 338,000 and 917,000, respectively. In China, FNFs account for 48.22% of hip fractures. Currently, many studies have been conducted on postdischarge mortality and mortality risk in patients with FNF. However, there have been no definitive studies on in-hospital mortality or its influencing factors in patients with severe FNF admitted to the intensive care unit. Objective: In this paper, 3 machine learning methods were used to construct a nosocomial death prediction model for patients admitted to intensive care units to assist clinicians in early clinical decision-making. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using information of a patient with FNF from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III. After balancing the data set using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique algorithm, patients were randomly separated into a 70% training set and a 30% testing set for the development and validation, respectively, of the prediction model. Random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and backpropagation neural network prediction models were constructed with nosocomial death as the outcome. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. The predictive value of the models was verified in comparison to the traditional logistic model. Results: A total of 366 patients with FNFs were selected, including 48 cases (13.1%) of in-hospital death. Data from 636 patients were obtained by balancing the data set with the in-hospital death group to survival group as 1:1. The 3 machine learning models exhibited high predictive accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and backpropagation neural network were 0.98, 0.97, and 0.95, respectively, all with higher predictive performance than the traditional logistic regression model. Ranking the importance of the feature variables, the top 10 feature variables that were meaningful for predicting the risk of in-hospital death of patients were the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, lactate, creatinine, gender, vitamin D, calcium, creatine kinase, creatine kinase isoenzyme, white blood cell, and age. Conclusions: Death risk assessment models constructed using machine learning have positive significance for predicting the in-hospital mortality of patients with severe disease and provide a valid basis for reducing in-hospital mortality and improving patient prognosis. © Lingxiao Xu, Jun Liu, Chunxia Han, Zisheng Ai.","assessment; decision-making; femoral neck fracture; fracture; hip; hospital mortality; ICU; intensive care unit; machine learning; mortality; prediction; prognosis; risk","","Z.

However, flap failure is associated with an additional hospital stay, medical cost burden, and mental stress. Therefore, understanding of the risk factors associated with this event is of utmost importance. AIM To develop machine learning-based predictive models for flap failure to identify the potential factors and screen out high-risk patients. METHODS Using the data set of 946 consecutive patients, who underwent microvascular tissue reconstruction of free flap reconstruction for head and neck, breast, back, and extremity, we established three machine learning models including random forest classifier, support vector machine, and gradient boosting. Model performances were evaluated by the indicators such as area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A multivariable regression analysis was performed for the most critical variables in the random forest model. RESULTS Post-surgery, the flap failure event occurred in 34 patients (3.6%). The machine learning models based on various preoperative and intraoperative variables were successfully developed. Among them, the random forest classifier reached the best performance in receiver operating characteristic curve, with an area under the curve score of 0.770 in the test set. The top 10 variables in the random forest were age, body mass index, ischemia time, smoking, diabetes, experience, prior chemotherapy, hypertension, insulin, and obesity. Interestingly, only age, body mass index, and ischemic time were statistically associated with the outcomes. CONCLUSION Machine learning-based algorithms, especially the random forest classifier, were very important in categorizing patients at high risk of flap failure. The occurrence of flap failure was a multifactordriven event and was identified with numerous factors that warrant further investigation. Importantly, the successful application of machine learning models may help the clinician in decision-making, understanding the underlying pathologic mechanisms of the disease, and improving the long-term outcome of patients © The Author(s) 2022.

Various techniques have been proposed in the literature to address this challenge with emphasis to medical applications. However, each one of the existing FS algorithms come with its own advantages and disadvantages introducing a certain level of bias. Materials and Methods: To avoid bias and alleviate the defectiveness of single feature selection results, an ensemble FS methodology is proposed in this paper that aggregates the results of several FS algorithms (filter, wrapper and embedded ones). Fuzzy logic is employed to combine multiple feature importance scores thus leading to a more robust selection of informative features. The proposed fuzzy ensemble FS methodology was applied on the problem of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction with special emphasis on the progression of joint space narrowing (JSN). The proposed FS methodology was integrated into an end-to-end machine learning pipeline and a thorough experimental evaluation was conducted using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database. Several classifiers were investigated for their suitability in the task of JSN prediction and the best performing model was then post-hoc analyzed by using the SHAP method. Results: The results showed that the proposed method presented a better and more stable performance in contrast to other competitive feature selection methods, leading to an average accuracy of 78.14% using XG Boost at 31 selected features. The post-hoc explainability highlighted the important features that contribute to the classification of patients with JSN progression. Conclusions: The proposed fuzzy feature selection approach improves the performance of the predictive models by selecting a small optimal subset of features compared to popular feature selection methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Classification problem; Feature selection; Fuzzy logic; JSN progression; KOA; Prediction models","Algorithms; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Machine Learning; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Classification (of information); Computer circuits; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Joints (anatomy); Medical applications; Classification problem; Ensemble feature selections; Feature selection algorithm; Features selection; Fuzzy-Logic; Important features; Joint space narrowing; Joint space narrowing progression; Knee osteoarthritis; Prediction modelling; adult; aged; Article; binary classification; classifier; diagnostic imaging; disease course; feature selection; female; food frequency questionnaire; fuzzy logic; fuzzy system; human; joint cavity; knee osteoarthritis; knee radiography; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical history; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical activity; post hoc analysis; prediction; predictive model; algorithm; fuzzy logic; Fuzzy logic","C.

As the number of cases in reduction zones rises, highly health officials are control that authorized treatment centers may become overrun with corona virus patients. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are machine coding that can be used to find complicate relationships between datasets. They enable the detection of category in complicated biological datasets that would be impossible to identify with traditional linear statistical analysis. To study the survival characteristics of patients, several computational techniques are used. Men and older age groups had greater mortality rates than women, according to this study. COVID-19 patients discharge times were predicted; also, utilizing various machine learning and statistical tools applied technically. In medical research, survival analysis is a regularly used technique for identifying relevant predictors of adverse outcomes and developing therapy guidelines for patients. Historically, demographic statistics have been used to predict outcomes in such patients. These projections, on the other hand, have little meaning for the individual patient. We present the training of neural networks to predict outcomes for individual patients at one institution, as well as their predictive performance using data from another institution in a different region.

Improvement in outcomes has remained largely unchanged in nearly 20 years. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is often used in diagnosis and management. Machine learning analyses of large-scale MRI data are pivotal in advancing the diagnosis, management and improve outcomes in neuro-oncology. A common challenge to robust machine learning approaches is the lack of large ‘ground truth’ datasets in supervised learning for building classification and prediction models. The creation of these datasets relies on human-expert input and is time-consuming and subjective error-prone, limiting effective machine learning applications. Simulation of mechanistic aspects such as geometry, location and physical properties of brain tumours can generate large-scale ground-truth datasets allowing for comparison of analysis techniques in clinical applications. We aimed to develop a transparent and convenient method for building ‘ground truth’ presentations of simulated glioma lesions on anatomical MRI. Materials/methods: The simulation workflow was created using the Feature Manipulation Engine (FME®), a data integration platform specializing in the spatial data processing. By compiling and integrating FME's functions to read, integrate, transform, validate, save, and display MRI data, and experimenting with ways to manipulate the parameters concerning location, size, shape, and signal intensity with the presentations of glioma, we were able to generate simulated appearances of high-grade gliomas on gadolinium-based high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI (1 mm3). Data of patients with canonical high-grade tumours were used as real-world tumours for validating the accuracy of the simulation. Twenty raters who are experienced with brain tumour interpretation on MRI independently completed a survey, designed to distinguish simulated and real-world brain tumours. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for assessing the performance of the approach with the binary classification of simulated vs real-world tumours. Correlation and regression were used in run time analysis, assessing the software toolset's efficiency in producing different numbers of simulated lesions. Differences in the group means were examined using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: The simulation method was developed as an interpretable and useful workflow for the easy creation of tumour simulations and incorporation into 3D MRI. A linear increase in the running time and memory usage was observed with an increasing number of generated lesions. The respondents' accuracy rate ranged between 33.3 and 83.3 %. The sensitivity and specificity were low for a human expert to differentiate simulated lesions from real gliomas (0.43 and 0.58) or vice versa (0.65 and 0.62). The mean scores ranking the real-world gliomas did not differ between the simulated and real tumours. Conclusion: The reliable and user-friendly software method can allow for robust simulation of high-grade glioma on MRI. Ongoing research efforts include optimizing the workflow for generating glioma datasets as well as adapting it to simulating additional MRI brain changes. © 2020","Brain tumour; Glioma; Ground truth; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Simulation","Brain Neoplasms; Glioma; Humans; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Quality of Life; Brain; Classification (of information); Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Data integration; Diagnosis; Large dataset; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Predictive analytics; gadolinium; Binary classification; Feature manipulation engines; Machine learning applications; Machine learning approaches; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging); Sensitivity and specificity; Spatial data processing; User-friendly-software; adult; Article; binary classification; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; digital imaging and communications in medicine; glioma; human; image analysis; machine learning; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; reliability; sensitivity and specificity; simulation; three-dimensional imaging; workflow; brain tumor; diagnostic imaging; glioma; machine learning; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quality of life; Tumors","A.V.

Limited data in healthcare, can arise for several reasons, namely when the number of subjects is insufficient or the observed time series is irregularly sampled at a very low sampling frequency. This is especially true when attempting to develop personalised models, as there are typically few data points available for training from an individual subject. Furthermore, the need for early prediction (as is often the case in healthcare applications) amplifies the problem of limited availability of data. This article proposes a novel personalised technique that can be learned in the absence of sufficient data for early prediction in time series. Our novelty lies in the development of a subset selection approach to select time series that share temporal similarities with the time series of interest, commonly known as the test time series. Then, a Gaussian processes-based model is learned using the existing test data and the chosen subset to produce personalised predictions for the test subject. We will conduct experiments with univariate and multivariate data from real-world healthcare applications to show that our strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art by around 20%.  © 2021 IEEE.","Forecasting; Gaussian processes; machine learning; time series analysis","Delivery of Health Care; Forecasting; Humans; Normal Distribution; Time Factors; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Harmonic analysis; Health care; Learning systems; Time series analysis; Early prediction; Gaussian Processes; Machine-learning; Medical services; Predictive models; Subset selection; Time-series analysis; Times series; Training data; article; dynamic time warping; machine learning; medical service; prediction; predictive model; forecasting; health care delivery; human; normal distribution; time factor; Forecasting","C.

In predictive information, these models are useful. It is utilized in examination applications like value forecast, hazard appraisal, anticipating client conduct, and report order. With nonstop information flooding in, the ML models guarantee that the arrangement is continually refreshed. With proper and continually changing information sources with regard to the Machine Learning Methods. ML is the structure of procedures and their use in the right scope. It is based on the knowledge of improvement of computer platforms that can access the information, examine it, and study from it. It is a portion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and must be able to adapt through knowledge. It must identify errors and correct them without being explicitly automated. The concepts of ML are used for getting the better predictive models. ML is required for tasks that are too difficult for humans to program openly. Certain tasks are so difficult that it is impossible, if not difficult,for humans to work out all of the nuances and program for them openly. So instead, we deliver a huge volume of information to a ML algorithm and let the algorithm effort it out by exploring that information and examining for a model that will complete what the programmers have agreed it out to attain. How well the model implements are determined by a cost function providing by the programmer and the task of the process is to discover a model that reduces the cost function. AI is the extensive learning of representing human capabilities; ML is an exact subclass of AI that trains ML. ML permits the customer to feed a computer algorithm a huge volume of information and have the computer evaluate and create data-driven approvals and decisions based on only the given input data. If any modifications are identified, then the algorithm can integrate that evidence to develop its future decision making. To better realize the usages of ML, consider various models where ML is applied. For example, the self-driving Google car, cyber fraud finding, and online recommendation engines such as Amazon and Netflix. Machines can allow all of these belongings by filtering suitable portions of information and restoring them together based on patterns to get accurate results. In this chapter, ML along with deep learning algorithms is explained. Nowadays, ML plays a vital role in prediction and analysis of various kinds of diseases. It is helpful in keeping track of the patient details and helps in identifying the most efficient algorithms in analysis of the patient data. In this chapter, we will discuss about the various algorithms and its applications in disease prediction. This chapter also analyzes how ML is applicable in medical field and challenges. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","Classification; Machine learning; Predictive model; Regression; Reinforcement learning; Supervised learning; Unsupervised learning","","M.S.

Owing to the benefits of handling massive and complicated data, XAI concept finds useful in several applications, particularly health care. With the developments of machine learning (ML) and XAI, healthcare service quality can be considerably improved. This article designs an optimal boosting label weighting extreme learning machine for mental disorder prediction and classification (OBWELM-MDC) technique. The goal of the OBWELM-MDC technique is to determine the different levels of DAS. In addition, the OBWELM-MDC technique involves the design of boosting label weighted extreme learning machine (BWELM) model for prediction process. Besides, the BWELM model can be derived by the incorporation of the label weighted extreme learning machine (LW-ELM) with boosted ensemble learning model. Moreover, the parameter tuning of the BWELM model takes place by the use of chaotic starling particle swarm optimization (CSPSO), where the inertia weight and acceleration coefficient of the PSO algorithm are modified via logistic chaotic map. The application of CSPSO algorithm has improved the predictive performance of the BWELM model. The experimental result analysis of the OBWELM-MDC technique takes place using benchmark dataset, and the results are examined under several measures. The experimental results showcased that OBWELM-MDC technique has accomplished maximum predictive outcomes over the other methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Explainable artificial intelligence; Health care; Machine learning; Medical data analysis; Mental disorder","","E.

Currently, thyroid specialists use medical images to diagnose then follow the treatment protocols, which have limitations due to unreliable human false-positive diagnostic rates. With the emergence of deep learning, advances in computer-aided diagnosis techniques have yielded promising earlier detection and prediction accuracy; however, clinicians' adoption is far lacking. The present study adopts Xception neural network as the base structure and designs a practical framework, which comprises three adaptable multi-channel architectures that were positively evaluated using real-world data sets. The proposed architectures outperform existing statistical and machine learning techniques and reached a diagnostic accuracy rate of 0.989 with ultrasound images and 0.975 with computed tomography scans through the single input dual-channel architecture. Moreover, the patient-specific design was implemented for thyroid cancer detection and has obtained an accuracy of 0.95 for double inputs dual-channel architecture and 0.94 for four-channel architecture. Our evaluation suggests that ultrasound images and computed tomography (CT) scans yield comparable diagnostic results through computer-aided diagnosis applications. With ultrasound images obtained slightly higher results, CT, on the other hand, can achieve the patient-specific diagnostic design. Besides, with the proposed framework, clinicians can select the best fitting architecture when making decisions regarding a thyroid cancer diagnosis. The proposed framework also incorporates interpretable results as evidence, which potentially improves clinicians' trust and hence their adoption of the computer-aided diagnosis techniques proposed with increased efficiency and accuracy. © 2022 Zhang et al.

The trajectories of patients in real-world settings are highly variable, making longitudinal data modeling challenging. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of deep learning models applied to time series; however, the application of these models to irregular medical time series (IMTS) remains limited. To address this issue, we developed a generic deep-learning-based framework for modeling IMTS that facilitates the comparative studies of sequential neural networks (transformers and long short-term memory) and irregular time representation techniques. A validation study to predict retinopathy complications was conducted on 1207 patients with type 1 diabetes in a French database using their historical glycosylated hemoglobin measurements, without any data aggregation or imputation. The transformer-based model combined with the soft one-hot representation of time gaps achieved the highest score: an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 88.65%, specificity of 85.56%, sensitivity of 83.33% and an improvement of 11.7% over the same architecture without time information. This is the first attempt to predict retinopathy complications in patients with type 1 diabetes using deep learning and longitudinal data collected from patient visits. This study highlighted the significance of modeling time gaps between medical records to improve prediction performance and the utility of a generic framework for conducting extensive comparative studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; HbA1c; Retinopathy; Time irregularity; Type 1 diabetes","Deep Learning; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Retinal Diseases; Deep learning; Eye protection; Forecasting; Learning systems; Time series; hemoglobin A1c; Comparatives studies; Deep learning; Hba1c; Learning frameworks; Longitudinal data; Medical time series; Retinopathy; Time gap; Time irregularity; Type 1 diabetes; adult; area under the curve; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; comparative study; convolutional neural network; cross validation; data aggregation; data base; deep learning; diabetes control; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic test accuracy study; feed forward neural network; female; follow up; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; logistic regression analysis; long short term memory network; major clinical study; male; multilabel classification; multilayer perceptron; onset age; prediction; predictive model; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; Review; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; target variable; time series analysis; validation study; complication; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; machine learning; retina disease; Large dataset","S.

Machine learning (ML) models can predict high-risk patients to help prevent adverse outcomes. Selecting the 'best' prediction model for a given disease, population, and clinical application is challenging due to the hundreds of health-related ML models in the literature and the increasing availability of ML methodologies. To support this decision process, we developed the Selection of Machine-learning Algorithms with ReplicaTions (SMART) Framework that integrates building and selecting ML models with decision theory. We build ML models and estimate performance for multiple plausible future populations with a replicated nested cross-validation technique. We rank ML models by simulating decision-maker priorities, using a range of accuracy measures (e.g., AUC) and robustness metrics from decision theory (e.g., minimax Regret). We present the SMART Framework through a case study on the microvascular complications of diabetes using data from the ACCORD clinical trial. We compare selections made by risk-averse, -neutral, and -seeking decision-makers, finding agreement in 80% of the risk-averse and risk-neutral selections, with the risk-averse selections showing consistency for a given complication. We also found that the models that best predicted outcomes in the validation set were those with low performance variance on the testing set, indicating a risk-averse approach in model selection is ideal when there is a potential for high population feature variability. The SMART Framework is a powerful, interactive tool that incorporates various ML algorithms and stakeholder preferences, generalizable to new data and technological advancements.  © 2013 IEEE.","Data-driven modeling; decision theory; diabetes; machine learning","Algorithms; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; Machine Learning; Blood vessels; Decision making; Decision theory; Learning systems; Learning to rank; Medical applications; Predictive analytics; Risk analysis; Accuracy measures; Clinical application; Decision process; Feature variability; High-risk patients; Nested cross validations; Robustness metrics; Technological advancement; area under the curve; Article; computer model; decision making; diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; health care access; kidney disease; kidney failure; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical model; microangiopathy; nerve cell network; nested cross validation; outcome assessment; qualitative research; social determinants of health; support vector machine; task performance; time series analysis; algorithm; diabetes mellitus; diabetic complication; human; machine learning; Learning algorithms","B.P.

Recently, large-scale epidemiological studies have demonstrated a relationship between several chronic disorders and ocular pathological conditions using an oculomics approach. We hypothesized that sarcopenia can be predicted through eye examinations, without invasive tests or radiologic evaluations in the context of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM). Methods: We analyzed data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). The training set (80%, randomly selected from 2008 to 2010) data were used to construct the machine learning models. Internal (20%, randomly selected from 2008 to 2010) and external (from the KNHANES 2011) validation sets were used to assess the ability to predict sarcopenia. We included 8092 participants in the final dataset. Machine learning models (XGBoost) were trained on ophthalmological examinations and demographic factors to detect sarcopenia. Results: In the exploratory analysis, decreased levator function (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; P value <0.001), cataracts (OR, 1.31; P value = 0.013), and age-related macular degeneration (OR, 1.38; P value = 0.026) were associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia in men. In women, an increased risk of sarcopenia was associated with blepharoptosis (OR, 1.23; P value = 0.038) and cataracts (OR, 1.29; P value = 0.010). The XGBoost technique showed areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.746 and 0.762 in men and women, respectively. The external validation achieved AUCs of 0.751 and 0.785 for men and women, respectively. For practical and fast hands-on experience with the predictive model for practitioners who may be willing to test the whole idea of sarcopenia prediction based on oculomics data, we developed a simple web-based calculator application (https://knhanesoculomics.github.io/sarcopenia) to predict the risk of sarcopenia and facilitate screening, based on the model established in this study. Conclusion: Sarcopenia is treatable before the vicious cycle of sarcopenia-related deterioration begins. Therefore, early identification of individuals at a high risk of sarcopenia is essential in the context of PPPM. Our oculomics-based approach provides an effective strategy for sarcopenia prediction. The proposed method shows promise in significantly increasing the number of patients diagnosed with sarcopenia, potentially facilitating earlier intervention. Through patient oculometric monitoring, various pathological factors related to sarcopenia can be simultaneously analyzed, and doctors can provide personalized medical services according to each cause. Further studies are needed to confirm whether such a prediction algorithm can be used in real-world clinical settings to improve the diagnosis of sarcopenia. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA).","Age-related macular degeneration; Blepharoptosis; Cataract; Demographic factors; Machine learning; Marker patterns; Oculomics; Ophthalmologic examination; Predictive model for practitioners﻿; Predictive preventive personalized medicine (PPPM / 3PM), Sarcopenia; Predictive algorithm; Risk assessment","","T.K.

There is a need for generalized and automatic pain detection and recognition methods. In this paper, stateof-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods in this field are analyzed as well as pain management techniques. Objective: The objective of the study is to analyze the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML in the analysis and management of pain and to disseminate this knowledge prompting future utilization by medical professionals. Study Design: A narrative review of the literature focusing on the latest algorithms in AI and ML for pain assessment and management. Methods: Research studies were collected using a literature search on PubMed, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore between 2018 and 2020. Results: The results of our assessment resulted in the identification of 47 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Pain assessment was the most studied subject with 11 studies, followed by automated measurements with 10 studies, spinal diagnosis with 8 studies, facial expression with 7 studies, pain assessment in special settings evaluated in 5 studies, 4 studies described treatment algorithms, and 2 studies assessed neonatal pain. These studies varied from simple to highly complex methodology. The majority of the studies suffered from inclusion of a small number of patients and without replication of results. However, considering AI and ML are dynamic and emerging specialties, the results shown here are promising. Consequently, we have described all the available literature in summary formats with commentary. Among the various assessments, facial expression and spinal diagnosis and management appear to be ready for inclusion as we continue to progress. Limitations: This review is not a systematic review of ML and AI applications in pain research. This review only provides a general idea of the upcoming techniques but does not provide an authoritative evidence-based conclusive opinion of their clinical application and effectiveness. Conclusion: While a majority of the studies focused on classification tasks, very few studies have explored the diagnosis and management of pain. Usage of ML techniques as support tools for clinicians holds an immense potential in the field of pain management. © 2022, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

Nonetheless, accurate prediction of future clinical end-points and robust definition of homogeneous cohorts are necessary for scientific investigation and targeted care. For this, unbiased recursive partitioning with conditional inference trees (URP-CTREE) have received increasing attention in medical research, especially, but not limited to traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCIs). URP-CTREE was introduced to SCI as a clinical guidance tool to explore and define homogeneous outcome groups by clinical means, while providing high accuracy in predicting future clinical outcomes. The validity and predictive value of URP-CTREE to provide improvements compared with other more common approaches applied by clinicians has recently come under critical scrutiny. Therefore, a comprehensive simulation study based on traumatic, cervical complete spinal cord injuries provides a framework to investigate and quantify the issues raised. First, we assessed the replicability and robustness of URP-CTREE to identify homogeneous subgroups. Second, we implemented a prediction performance comparison of URP-CTREE with traditional statistical techniques, such as linear or logistic regression, and a novel machine learning method. URP-CTREE's ability to identify homogeneous subgroups proved to be replicable and robust. In terms of prediction, URP-CTREE yielded a high prognostic performance comparable to a machine learning algorithm. The simulation study provides strong evidence for the robustness of URP-CTREE, which is achieved without compromising prediction accuracy. The slightly lower prediction performance is offset by URP-CTREE's straightforward interpretation and application in clinical settings based on simple, data-driven decision rules.

Application of Machine learning algorithms on data analyzed from a patient provides reliable performance as that achieved by diagnosing Heart disease. The growth in technology has improved the information or data which can be extracted from a patient to help pinpoint the cause of illness. Using fourteen of such attributes or data from the medical profile of a patient can predict the chance of a patient developing a heart condition. In simple terms, these attributes are loaded into logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN and Naive bayes, that is, Machine learning (ML) algorithms for the analysis and further prediction of heart disease. There are many other techniques, methods used by other researchers, however we have stuck to data analytics and the three algorithms mentioned earlier. By using this method, the standards in the medical industries are elevated and rose as they can provide better diagnostics and treatment of the patient, resulting in providing an overall good quality service.

The performance of a deep learning model generally improves with the size of the training data. However, there are privacy, ownership, and regulatory issues that prevent combining medical data into traditional centralized storage. Decentralized learning approaches enable collaborative model training by distributing the learning process among several nodes or devices. Conceptually, decentralized learning builds on earlier work in distributed optimization, but the focus of this paper is on recent and emerging techniques such as Federated Learning (FL), Split Learning (SL), and hybrid Split-Federated Learning (SFL). With common, universal deep learning models and centralized aggregator servers, FL overcomes the difficulties of centralized training. Additionally, patient data remains at the local party, upholding the security and anonymity of the data. SL enables machine learning without directly accessing data on clients or end devices. It further enhances privacy in a decentralized setting and mitigates clients' storage issues. In this survey, we first provide a contemporary survey of FL, SL, and SFL approaches. Second, we discuss their state-of-the-art applications in healthcare, particularly in medical image analysis. Third, we review these emerging decentralized learning approaches under challenging conditions such as statistical and system heterogeneity, privacy preservation, communication efficiency, fairness, etc. Then, we address existing approaches to tackle these challenges. We detail unique complications related to healthcare applications including data, privacy and security, and communication challenges. Finally, we outline potential areas for further research on emerging decentralized learning techniques in healthcare, including developing personalized models, reducing bias, incorporating hybrid non-IID features, hyperparameter tuning, developing sufficient incentive mechanisms, and incorporating domain expertise knowledge. © 2013 IEEE.","Data privacy; federated learning; healthcare; hybrid split-federated learning; split learning","Deep learning; Digital storage; Health care; Hospital data processing; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Computational modelling; Decentralized learning; Federated learning; Healthcare; Hybrid split-federated learning; Learning approach; Machine-learning; Medical services; Predictive models; Split learning; Data privacy","C.

Oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of thromboembolic stroke in those at higher risk; but for a number of patients, stroke is the first manifestation of undetected AF. There is a rationale for the early diagnosis of AF, before the first complication occurs, but population-based screening is not recommended. Previous prediction models have been limited by their data sources and methodologies. An accurate model that uses existing routinely collected data is needed to inform clinicians of patient-level risk of AF, inform national screening policy and highlight predictors that may be amenable to primary prevention. Methods and analysis We will investigate the application of a range of deep learning techniques, including an adapted convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and Transformer, on routinely collected primary care data to create a personalised model predicting the risk of new-onset AF over a range of time periods. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)-GOLD dataset will be used for derivation, and the CPRD-AURUM dataset will be used for external geographical validation. Both comprise a sizeable representative population and are linked at patient-level to secondary care databases. The performance of the deep learning models will be compared against classic machine learning and traditional statistical predictive modelling methods. We will only use risk factors accessible in primary care and endow the model with the ability to update risk prediction as it is presented with new data, to make the model more useful in clinical practice. Ethics and dissemination Permissions for CPRD-GOLD and CPRD-AURUM datasets were obtained from CPRD (ref no: 19_076). The CPRD ethical approval committee approved the study. The results will be submitted as a research paper for publication to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at peer-reviewed conferences.

One strategy to use machine learning in clinical risk prediction is to classify outcomes over a given time horizon. However, it is not well-known how to identify the optimal time horizon for risk prediction. Objective: In this study, we aim to identify an optimal time horizon for classification of incident myocardial infarction (MI) using machine learning approaches looped over outcomes with increasing time horizons. Additionally, we sought to compare the performance of these models with the traditional Framingham Heart Study (FHS) coronary heart disease gender-specific Cox proportional hazards regression model. Methods: We analyzed data from a single clinic visit of 5201 participants of a cardiovascular health study. We examined 61 variables collected from this baseline exam, including demographic and biologic data, medical history, medications, serum biomarkers, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic data. We compared several machine learning methods (eg, random forest, L1 regression, gradient boosted decision tree, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor) trained to predict incident MI that occurred within time horizons ranging from 500-10,000 days of follow-up. Models were compared on a 20% held-out testing set using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Variable importance was performed for random forest and L1 regression models across time points. We compared results with the FHS coronary heart disease gender-specific Cox proportional hazards regression functions. Results: There were 4190 participants included in the analysis, with 2522 (60.2%) female participants and an average age of 72.6 years. Over 10,000 days of follow-up, there were 813 incident MI events. The machine learning models were most predictive over moderate follow-up time horizons (ie, 1500-2500 days). Overall, the L1 (Lasso) logistic regression demonstrated the strongest classification accuracy across all time horizons. This model was most predictive at 1500 days follow-up, with an AUROC of 0.71. The most influential variables differed by follow-up time and model, with gender being the most important feature for the L1 regression and weight for the random forest model across all time frames. Compared with the Framingham Cox function, the L1 and random forest models performed better across all time frames beyond 1500 days. Conclusions: In a population free of coronary heart disease, machine learning techniques can be used to predict incident MI at varying time horizons with reasonable accuracy, with the strongest prediction accuracy in moderate follow-up periods. Validation across additional populations is needed to confirm the validity of this approach in risk prediction. © Steven Simon, Divneet Mandair, Abdel Albakri, Alison Fohner, Noah Simon, Leslie Lange, Mary Biggs, Kenneth Mukamal, Bruce Psaty, Michael Rosenberg.

Understanding 'artificial neural networks' principles and 'deep learning', as well as their theories and applications in medical image processing, is essential for computer vision professionals. Medical image processing for the assessment and treatment of complicated illnesses from various ranges and diverse data continues to be a difficulty in providing better care. Both unsupervised and 'supervised deep learning' has shown promise in the field of medical image analysis in recent years. There have been several evaluations of supervised deep learning, but there has been little research on unsupervised deep learning for medical picture processing. Over the next 15 years, 'deep learning techniques' applied to 'Medical Image analysis' might be a game-changing technique. Uses of deep learning in medical services will address a wide range of issues, including cancer screening and illness controlling to individualized therapy recommendations. In healthcare, 'deep learning' approaches are sometimes referred to as 'black boxes'. Because responsibility is now more important and can have serious legal implications, a decent predictive model is frequently insufficient. In order to gather theory-based data related to deep learning algorithms to help to analyse medical images, this research has selected a secondary qualitative method for detailed discussion. © 2022 IEEE.","'Artificial Intelligence' or AI; 'Convolutional neural networks' or CNN; 'Machine Learning' or ML; classification; Deep learning or DL; detection; Medical image","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Image analysis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; 'artificial intelligence' or AI; 'convolutional neural network' or CNN; 'machine learning' or ML; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning or DL; Detection; Machine-learning; Medical image; Medical image analysis; Medical images processing; Image classification","J.

Most acute or long-term care patients are at risk of developing PI. Machine Learning (ML) has been utilized to manage patients with PI, in which one systematic review describes how ML is used in PI management in 32 studies. This research, different from the previous systematic review, summarizes the previous contributions of ML in PI from January 2007 to July 2022, categorizes the studies according to medical specialties, analyzes gaps, and identifies opportunities for future research directions. PRISMA guidelines were adopted using the four most common databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct) and other resources, which result in 90 eligible studies. The reviewed articles are divided into three categories based on PI time of occurrence: before occurrence (48%); at time of occurrence (16%); and after occurrence (36%). Each category is further broken down into sub-fields based on medical specialties, which result in sixteen specialties. Each specialty is analyzed in terms of methods, inputs, and outputs. The most relevant and potentially useful applications and methods in PI management are outlined and discussed. This includes deep learning techniques and hybrid models, integration of existing risk assessment tools with ML that leads to a partnership between provider assessment and patients’ Electronic Health Records (EHR). © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; bedsores; clinical decision support; deep learning; hospital-acquired pressure injuries; machine learning; predictive analytics; pressure injury; pressure ulcer; PRISMA; systematic review; wound image analysis","Electronic Health Records; Humans; Machine Learning; Pressure Ulcer; United States; artificial intelligence; decision support system; guideline; health status; hospital sector; image analysis; injury; machine learning; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; convolutional neural network; data extraction; decubitus; deep learning; electronic health record; hospitalization; human; information processing; machine learning; nerve cell network; principal component analysis; recurrent neural network; Review; risk assessment; ScienceDirect; systematic review; machine learning","O.Y.

The breadth and depth of such data, alongside experimental noise and missing values, requires a sophisticated human-machine interaction that would allow effective learning from complex data and accurate forecasting of future outcomes, ideally embedded in the core of machine learning design. Objective: In this review, we will discuss machine learning techniques utilized for modeling of treatment response in cancer, including Random Forests, support vector machines, neural networks, and linear and logistic regression. We will overview their mathematical foundations and discuss their limitations and alternative approaches in light of their application to therapeutic response modeling in cancer. Conclusion: We hypothesize that the increase in the number of patient profiles and potential temporal monitoring of patient data will define even more complex techniques, such as deep learning and causal analysis, as central players in therapeutic response modeling. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Cancer; Data repositories; Machine learning; Prediction; Therapeutic resistance; Therapeutic response","androgen receptor; carboplatin; gemcitabine; paclitaxel; tamoxifen; androgen deprivation therapy; artificial neural network; big data; bioinformatics; brain depth stimulation; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer staging; clinical decision making; computer assisted tomography; decision tree; deep learning; DNA methylation; drug response; forecasting; gene expression; gene expression level; gene mutation; genetic algorithm; genetic analysis; human; knowledge; learning algorithm; logistic regression analysis; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; machine learning; malignant neoplasm; mean squared error; medical informatics; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; nerve cell network; ovary cancer; patient coding; prediction; predictive model; principal component analysis; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; random forest; regression analysis; Review; RNA sequencing; support vector machine; tertiary care center; training; treatment response; tumor volume; whole exome sequencing","A.

It is a big worldwide threat with serious health and economic implications. To solve this, researchers are developing automated stroke prediction algorithms, which would allow for early intervention and perhaps save lives. The number of people at risk for stroke is growing as the population ages, making precise and effective prediction systems increasingly critical. wo In a comparison examination with six well-known classifiers, the effectiveness of the proposed ML technique was explored in terms of metrics relating to both generalization capability and prediction accuracy. To give insight into the black-box machine learning models, we also studied two kinds of explainable techniques, namely SHAP and LIME, in this study. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) are well-established and reliable approaches for explaining model decision-making, particularly in the medical industry. The findings of the experiment revealed that more complicated models outperformed simpler ones, with the top model obtaining almost 91% accuracy and the other models achieving 83-91% accuracy. The proposed framework, which includes global and local explainable methodologies, can aid in standardizing complicated models and gaining insight into their decision-making, which can enhance stroke care and treatment.  © 2013 IEEE.","ANOVA test; data leakage; explainable machine learning; LIME; SHAPE; Stroke prediction","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Diagnosis; Health risks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Lime; Medical imaging; Patient treatment; Statistical tests; ANOVA test; Data leakage; Explainable machine learning; Local interpretable model-agnostic explanation; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Medical conditions; Medical diagnostic imaging; Medical services; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; SHAPE; Stroke (medical condition); Stroke prediction; Forecasting","J.

The goal of this study is therefore centralized around determining the extent to which soft computing techniques have positively impacted the quality of physician care and their effectiveness in tropical disease diagnosis. The study has used PRISMA guidelines to identify paper selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria. It was determined that the highest frequency of articles utilized ensemble techniques for classification, prediction, analysis, diagnosis, etc., over single machine learning techniques, followed by neural networks. The results identified dengue fever as the most studied disease, followed by malaria and tuberculosis. It was also revealed that accuracy was the most common metric utilized to evaluate the predictive capability of a classification mode. The information presented within these studies benefits frontline healthcare workers who could depend on soft computing techniques for accurate diagnoses of tropical diseases. Although our research shows an increasing interest in using machine learning techniques for diagnosing tropical diseases, there still needs to be more studies.

Bacteraemia prognosis primarily depends on a rapid diagnosis. The bacteraemia prediction would shorten up to 6 days the diagnosis, and, in conjunction with individual patient variables, should be considered to start the early administration of personalised antibiotic treatment and medical services, the election of specific diagnostic techniques and the determination of additional treatments, such as surgery, that would prevent subsequent complications. Machine learning techniques could help physicians make these informed decisions by predicting bacteraemia using the data already available in electronic hospital records. Objective: This study presents the application of machine learning techniques to these records to predict the blood culture’s outcome, which would reduce the lag in starting a personalised antibiotic treatment and the medical costs associated with erroneous treatments due to conservative assumptions about blood culture outcomes. Methods: Six supervised classifiers were created using three machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours, on the electronic health records of hospital patients. The best approach to handle missing data was chosen and, for each machine learning technique, two classification models were created: the first uses the features known at the time of blood extraction, whereas the second uses four extra features revealed during the blood culture. Results: The six classifiers were trained and tested using a dataset of 4357 patients with 117 features per patient. The models obtain predictions that, for the best case, are up to a state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.9%, a sensitivity of 87.4% and an AUC of 0.93. Conclusions: Our results provide cutting-edge metrics of interest in predictive medical models with values that exceed the medical practice threshold and previous results in the literature using classical modelling techniques in specific types of bacteraemia. Additionally, the consistency of results is reasserted because the three classifiers’ importance ranking shows similar features that coincide with those that physicians use in their manual heuristics. Therefore, the efficacy of these machine learning techniques confirms their viability to assist in the aims of predictive and personalised medicine once the disease presents bacteraemia-compatible symptoms and to assist in improving the healthcare economy. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bacteraemia diagnosis; Bacteraemia prediction; Blood culture’s outcome prediction; COVID-19; Health policy; Healthcare economy; Individualised electronic patient record analysis; K-Nearest neighbours; Machine learning; Modelling; Personalised antibiotic treatment; Predictive; Preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM/3PM); Random forest; Support vector machine","aged; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacteremia; blood culture; blood sampling; classifier; clinical outcome; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; electronic health record; female; health care cost; hospital infection; hospital patient; human; infection prevention; k nearest neighbor; major clinical study; male; medical error; personalized medicine; prediction; predictive value; random forest; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine","O.

This explosion in available data for further analysis is as evident in medicine as it is elsewhere. Numerous artificial intelligence techniques been applied to different medical problems with the aim of automating time-consuming, and often subjective, manual tasks implemented by practitioners in diverse specialties. This chapter focuses on several real-world applications in ophthalmic image analysis. In this context, the objective quality assessment of retinal images plays an important role to guarantee the success of any computer-aided system. For this reason, we first present a case study on retinal image quality assessment, which uses computer vision and machine learning techniques. Additionally, we introduce two other case studies: the automatic computation of the arteriolar-to-venular index, a predictive biomarker of cerebral atrophy and cardiovascular events; and the automatic diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity, a disease affecting low birth weight infants that shows a high amount of disagreement among experts. The experimental results presented were obtained on several datasets, both public and private, and demonstrate their suitability to be used in daily practice, both for clinical and research purposes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Image analysis; Machine learning; Ophthalmology; Retinal image","","B.

Methods: We included adult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission with complete clinical data until ICU death or discharge. We examined the importance of factors associated with disease progression over the first week, implementation and responsiveness to interventions used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ICU outcome. We used machine learning (ML) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to characterise the evolution of clinical parameters and our ICU data visualisation tool is available as a web-based widget (https://www.CovidUK.ICU). Results: Data for 633 adults with COVID-19 who underwent IMV between 01 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 were analysed. Overall mortality was 43.3% and highest with non-resolution of hypoxaemia [60.4% vs17.6%; P < 0.001; median PaO2/FiO2 on the day of death was 12.3(8.9–18.4) kPa] and non-response to proning (69.5% vs.31.1%; P < 0.001). Two ML models using weeklong data demonstrated an increased predictive accuracy for mortality compared to admission data (74.5% and 76.3% vs 60%, respectively). XAI models highlighted the increasing importance, over the first week, of PaO2/FiO2 in predicting mortality. Prone positioning improved oxygenation only in 45% of patients. A higher peak pressure (OR 1.42[1.06–1.91]; P < 0.05), raised respiratory component (OR 1.71[1.17–2.5]; P < 0.01) and cardiovascular component (OR 1.36 [1.04–1.75]; P < 0.05) of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and raised lactate (OR 1.33 [0.99–1.79]; P = 0.057) immediately prior to application of prone positioning were associated with lack of oxygenation response. Prone positioning was not applied to 76% of patients with moderate hypoxemia and 45% of those with severe hypoxemia and patients who died without receiving proning interventions had more missed opportunities for prone intervention [7 (3–15.5) versus 2 (0–6); P < 0.001]. Despite the severity of gas exchange deficit, most patients received lung-protective ventilation with tidal volumes less than 8 mL/kg and plateau pressures less than 30cmH2O. This was despite systematic errors in measurement of height and derived ideal body weight. Conclusions: Refractory hypoxaemia remains a major association with mortality, yet evidence based ARDS interventions, in particular prone positioning, were not implemented and had delayed application with an associated reduced responsiveness. Real-time service evaluation techniques offer opportunities to assess the delivery of care and improve protocolised implementation of evidence-based ARDS interventions, which might be associated with improvements in survival. © 2021, The Author(s).","ARDS; Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Mechanical ventilation; Mortality risk; Prone position","Adult; Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Humans; Prone Position; Respiration, Artificial; SARS-CoV-2; United Kingdom; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; all cause mortality; Article; artificial intelligence; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; data visualization; female; gas exchange; Horowitz index; human; hypoxemia; ideal body weight; intensive care unit; intermittent mandatory ventilation; invasive ventilation; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical history; mortality risk; multicenter study; observational study; oxygenation; prone position; protective ventilation; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; systematic error; tidal volume; United Kingdom; ventilated patient; artificial ventilation; United Kingdom","B.V.

This paper proposes a novel categorical regression (CATREG) model using optimal scaling technique in Gifi system to resolve the current existing problem by transforming the categorical data to a continuous data and then performing the analysis of the data in the new transformed Gifi space. Such transformation preserves the scaling properties of the original variables without loss of any information and mapping is one-to-one and onto, unlike the kernel mapping in feature space in machine learning. We introduce a hybridized model selection via the information complexity (ICOMP) criterion along with the genetic algorithm (GA) in CATREG model and provide interpretable results. Two real numerical examples are provided to study the effects of the cell phone usage on the sleep patterns of individuals, and a second example is based on building a predictive model of e-commerce for new car market. In both of these numerical examples subset selection of the best predictor variables are determined to build an optimal predictive model. Our results show the efficiency and the versatility of the proposed new approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","E-commerce; Genetic algorithm; Gifi system; Information complexity; New car market; Optimal scaling; Sleep patterns","Behavioral research; Clustering algorithms; Computational complexity; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Mapping; Metadata; Statistics; Car markets; Categorical data; E- commerces; Gifi system; Information complexity; Model Selection; New car market; Optimal scaling; Scalings; Sleep pattern; Genetic algorithms","H.

Significant efforts have been made in recent years to develop computer-aided diagnostic applications, as failures in medical diagnosing processes can result in medical therapies that are severely deceptive. Machine learning (ML) is important in Computer Aided Diagnostic test. Object such as body-organs cannot be identified correctly after using an easy equation. Therefore, pattern recognition essentially requires training from instances. In the bio medical area, pattern detection and ML promises to improve the reliability of disease approach and detection. They also respect the dispassion of the method of decisions making. ML provides a respectable approach to make superior and automated algorithm for the study of high dimension and multi - modal bio medicals data.

In our study the discursive framing of depression is explored in online health communities. Three discursive frameworks are introduced: the bio-medical, psychological, and social framings of depression. ~80 000 posts were collected, and a sample of them was manually classified. Conventional bag-of-words models, Gradient Boosting Machine, word-embedding-based models and a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model with transfer learning, called DistilBERT were applied to expand this classification on the whole database. According to our experience ‘discursive framing’ proves to be a complex and hermeneutically difficult concept, which affects the degree of both inter-annotator agreement and predictive performance. Our finding confirms that the level of inter-annotator disagreement provides a good estimate for the objective difficulty of the classification. By identifying the most important terms, we also interpreted the classification algorithms, which is of great importance in social sciences. We are convinced that machine learning techniques can extend the horizon of qualitative text analysis. Our paper supports a smooth fit of the new techniques into the traditional toolbox of social sciences. © 2022, The Author(s).","Framing of depression; Gradient boosting machine; Natural language processing; Online forums; Supervised machine learning; Transformer-based model","","R.

A delay in diagnosis leads to more advanced stages of BC and a lower chance of survival, which makes this cancer even more fatal. Objectives: The present study was aimed at identifying the predicting factors for delayed BC diagnosis in women in Iran. Methods: In this study, four machine learning methods, including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), neural networks (NNs), and logistic regression (LR), were applied to analyze the data of 630 women with confirmed BC. Also, different statistical methods, including chi-square, p-value, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were utilized in different steps of the survey. Results: Thirty percent of patients had a delayed BC diagnosis. Of all the patients with delayed diagnoses, 88.5% were married, 72.1% had an urban residency, and 84.8% had health insurance. The top three important factors in the RF model were urban residency (12.04), breast disease history (11.58), and other comorbidities (10.72). In the XGBoost, urban residency (17.54), having other comorbidities (17.14), and age at first childbirth (>30) (13.13) were the top factors; in the LR model, having other comorbidities (49.41), older age at first childbirth (82.57), and being nulliparous (44.19) were the top factors. Finally, in the NN, it was found that being married (50.05), having a marriage age above 30 (18.03), and having other breast disease history (15.83) were the main predicting factors for a delayed BC diagnosis. Conclusion: Machine learning techniques suggest that women with an urban residency who got married or had their first child at an age older than 30 and those without children are at a higher risk of diagnosis delay. It is necessary to educate them about BC risk factors, symptoms, and self-breast examination to shorten the delay in diagnosis.

For proper and effective management of oral cancer, early diagnosis and accurate prediction of prognosis are important. To achieve this, artificial intelligence (AI) or its subfield, machine learning, has been touted for its potential to revolutionize cancer management through improved diagnostic precision and prediction of outcomes. Yet, to date, it has made only few contributions to actual medical practice or patient care. Objectives: This study provides a systematic review of diagnostic and prognostic application of machine learning in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and also highlights some of the limitations and concerns of clinicians towards the implementation of machine learning-based models for daily clinical practice. Data sources: We searched OvidMedline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) databases from inception until February 2020 for articles that used machine learning for diagnostic or prognostic purposes of OSCC. Eligibility criteria: Only original studies that examined the application of machine learning models for prognostic and/or diagnostic purposes were considered. Data extraction: Independent extraction of articles was done by two researchers (A.R. & O.Y) using predefine study selection criteria. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) in the searching and screening processes. We also used Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) for assessing the risk of bias (ROB) and quality of included studies. Results: A total of 41 studies were published to have used machine learning to aid in the diagnosis/or prognosis of OSCC. The majority of these studies used the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms as machine learning techniques. Their specificity ranged from 0.57 to 1.00, sensitivity from 0.70 to 1.00, and accuracy from 63.4 % to 100.0 % in these studies. The main limitations and concerns can be grouped as either the challenges inherent to the science of machine learning or relating to the clinical implementations. Conclusion: Machine learning models have been reported to show promising performances for diagnostic and prognostic analyses in studies of oral cancer. These models should be developed to further enhance explainability, interpretability, and externally validated for generalizability in order to be safely integrated into daily clinical practices. Also, regulatory frameworks for the adoption of these models in clinical practices are necessary. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Explainable AI; Machine learning; Oral squamous cell carcinoma; Systematic review","Artificial Intelligence; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Machine Learning; Mouth Neoplasms; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Diagnosis; Diseases; Extraction; Forecasting; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Risk assessment; Search engines; Support vector machines; Effective management; Eligibility criterion; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Oral squamous cell carcinomata; Prognostic analysis; Regulatory frameworks; accuracy; artificial neural network; autofluorescence; automation; Bayesian network; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; clinical practice; confocal laser scanning microscopy; convolutional neural network; decision tree; deep neural network; disease specific survival; feature selection; fuzzy system; histopathology; human; immunohistochemistry; k nearest neighbor; lymph node metastasis; machine learning; mouth cancer; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; multilayer perceptron; overall survival; priority journal; random forest; relevance vector machine; Review; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; survival rate; systematic review; tongue carcinoma; artificial intelligence; head and neck tumor; machine learning; meta analysis; mouth tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; Learning systems","R.O.

There is growing recognition that postsurgical satisfaction is shaped not only by the quality of surgery but also by psychological and social factors. Surprisingly, information on the psychological and social determinants of surgical outcomes is rarely collected before surgery. A comprehensive collection of biopsychosocial information could assist clinicians in making recommendations in relation to rehabilitation, particularly if there is robust evidence to support the ability of presurgical constructs to predict postsurgical outcomes. Clinical decision support tools can help identify factors influencing patient outcomes and support the provision of interventions or services that can be tailored to meet individuals’ needs. However, despite their potential clinical benefit, the application of such tools remains limited. Objective: This study aims to develop a clinical decision tool that will assist with patient stratification and more precisely targeted clinical decision-making regarding prehabilitation and rehabilitation for TKA, based on the identified individual biopsychosocial needs. Methods: In this prospective observational study, all participants provided written or electronic consent before study commencement. Patient-completed questionnaires captured information related to a broad range of biopsychosocial parameters during the month preceding TKA. These included demographic factors (sex, age, and rurality), psychological factors (mood status, pain catastrophizing, resilience, and committed action), quality of life, social support, lifestyle factors, and knee symptoms. Physical measures assessing mobility, balance, and functional lower body strength were performed via video calls with patients in their home. Information related to preexisting health issues and concomitant medications was derived from hospital medical records. Patient recovery outcomes were assessed 3 months after the surgical procedure and included quality of life, patient-reported knee symptoms, satisfaction with the surgical procedure, and mood status. Machine learning data analysis techniques will be applied to determine which presurgery parameters have the strongest power for predicting patient recovery following total knee replacement. On the basis of these analyses, a predictive model will be developed. Predictive models will undergo internal validation, and Bayesian analysis will be applied to provide additional metrics regarding prediction accuracy. Results: Patient recruitment and data collection commenced in November 2019 and was completed in June 2022. A total of 1050 patients who underwent TKA were enrolled in this study. Conclusions: Our findings will facilitate the development of the first comprehensive biopsychosocial prediction tool, which has the potential to objectively predict a patient’s individual recovery outcomes following TKA once selected by an orthopedic surgeon to undergo TKA. If successful, the tool could also inform the evolution rehabilitation services, such that factors in addition to physical performance can be addressed and have the potential to further enhance patient recovery and satisfaction. © Karen Ribbons, Sarah Johnson, Elizabeth Ditton, Adrian Wills, Gillian Mason, Traci Flynn, Jodie Cochrane, Michael Pollack, Frederick Rohan Walker, Michael Nilsson.","biopsychosocial; clinical decision support; knee arthroplasty; patient recruitment; patient stratification; patient-reported outcome; patient-reported outcomes; predictive clinical decision tool; presurgery; prospective; psychosocial; quality of life; recovery trajectories; rehabilitation; total knee arthroplasty","","K.

Many methods under the assumption of MAR are available. Under the assumption of MNAR, likelihood-based methods require specification of the joint distribution of the data, and the missingness mechanism has been introduced as sensitivity analysis. These classic models heavily rely on the underlying assumption, and, in many realistic scenarios, they can produce unreliable estimates. In this paper, we develop a machine learning based missing data prediction framework with the aim of handling more realistic missing data scenarios. We use an imbalanced learning technique (i.e., oversampling of minority class) to handle the MNAR data. To implement oversampling in longitudinal continuous variable, we first perform clustering via (Formula presented.) -mean trajectories. And use the recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the longitudinal data. Further, we apply bootstrap aggregating to improve the accuracy of prediction and also to consider the uncertainty of a single prediction. We evaluate the proposed method using simulated data. The prediction result is evaluated at the individual patient level and the overall population level. We demonstrate the powerful predictive capability of RNN for longitudinal data and its flexibility for nonlinear modeling. Overall, the proposed method provides an accurate individual prediction for both MAR and MNAR data and reduce the bias of missing data in treatment effect estimation when compared to standard methods and classic models. Finally, we implement the proposed method in a real dataset from an antidepressant clinical trial. In summary, this paper offers an opportunity to encourage the integration of machine learning strategies for handling of missing data in the analysis of randomized clinical trials. © 2022 The Authors.

In this work, we sought to apply Machine Learning (ML) to gold standard clinical data obtained across thousands of children at-risk for autism spectrum disorder to create a low-cost, quick, and easy to apply autism screening tool. Methods: Two algorithms are trained to identify autism, one based on short, structured parent-reported questionnaires and the other on tagging key behaviors from short, semi-structured home videos of children. A combination algorithm is then used to combine the results into a single assessment of higher accuracy. To overcome the scarcity, sparsity, and imbalance of training data, we apply novel feature selection, feature engineering, and feature encoding techniques. We allow for inconclusive determination where appropriate in order to boost screening accuracy when conclusive. The performance is then validated in a controlled clinical study. Results: A multi-center clinical study of n=162 children is performed to ascertain the performance of these algorithms and their combination. We demonstrate a significant accuracy improvement over standard screening tools in measurements of AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a mobile, machine learning process is a reliable method for detection of autism outside of clinical settings. A variety of confounding factors in the clinical analysis are discussed along with the solutions engineered into the algorithms. Final results are statistically limited and will benefit from future clinical studies to extend the sample size. © The Author(s) 2018.

In many applications, fitting a regression model with only linear effects may not be sufficient for predictive or explanatory purposes. One strategy that has recently received increasing attention in statistics is to include feature interactions to capture the nonlinearity in the regression model. Such model has been applied successfully in many biomedical applications. One major challenge in the use of such model is that the data dimensionality is significantly higher than the original data, resulting in the small sample size large dimension problem. Recently, weak hierarchical Lasso, a sparse interaction regression model, is proposed that produces a sparse and hierarchical structured estimator by exploiting the Lasso penalty and a set of hierarchical constraints. However, the hierarchical constraints make it a non-convex problem and the existing method finds the solution to its convex relaxation, which needs additional conditions to guarantee the hierarchical structure. In this article, we propose to directly solve the non-convex weak hierarchical Lasso by making use of the General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) optimization framework, which has been shown to be efficient for solving non-convex sparse formulations. The key step in GIST is to compute a sequence of proximal operators. One of our key technical contributions is to show that the proximal operator associated with the non-convex weak hierarchical Lasso admits a closed-form solution. However, a naive approach for solving each subproblem of the proximal operator leads to a quadratic time complexity, which is not desirable for large-size problems. We have conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. Results show that our proposed algorithm is much more efficient and effective than its convex relaxation. To this end, we further develop an efficient algorithm for computing the subproblems with a linearithmic time complexity. In addition, we extend the technique to perform the optimization-based hierarchical testing of pairwise interactions for binary classification problems, which is essentially the proximal operator associated with weak hierarchical Lasso. Simulation studies show that the non-convex hierarchical testing framework outperforms the convex relaxation when a hierarchical structure exists between main effects and interactions. © 2016 ACM.","And Phrases: Sparse learning; Non-convex; Proximal operator; Weak hierarchical Lasso","Data mining; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Medical applications; Relaxation processes; And Phrases: Sparse learning; Binary classification problems; Biomedical applications; Hierarchical structures; Non-convex; Optimization framework; Proximal operator; Weak hierarchical Lasso; Regression analysis","","","Association for Computing Machinery","15564681","","","","English","ACM Trans.

However, evaluating the predictive performance of these methods can be challenging. While simple measures such as total accuracy have been widely used to assess the classification performance of these algorithms, studies show that relying solely on these individual measures can be misleading. One of the techniques that can be used to organize classifiers and visualize their performance is receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. ROC curves are commonly used in machine learning and data mining studies to improve medical decision making; however, their application in construction safety is minimal. This study evaluates the application of ROC curves to more accurately interpret the output of machine learning methods, because understanding the mechanism of ROC curves will improve the classification performance of machine learning methods (i.e., AdaBoost) when predicting the degree of construction injuries. To achieve this goal, more than 700 accident reports were collected from national databases and analyzed via multiple machine learning techniques. The findings of this study indicate that applying ROC curves can yield the selection of better classification criteria and can reduce the cost of classification errors. The method is particularly beneficial when the costs of errors are unequal or when the data is highly imbalanced. © 2018 ASCE.","","Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Highway accidents; Medical computing; Advanced analysis methods; Classification criterion; Classification performance; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Medical decision making; Predictive performance; Receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC); Learning systems","","Harper C.; Lee Y.; Harris R.; Berryman C.; Wang C.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","978-078448128-8","","","English","Constr.

The clinical view of the network-based approach is greatly supported by the general law of molecular interconnection governing all biological complex systems.

Data mining is the search for relationships and patterns within this data that could provide useful knowledge for effective decision-making. Classification analysis is one of the widely adopted data mining techniques for healthcare applications to support medical diagnosis, improving quality of patient care, etc. Usually medical databases are high dimensional in nature. If a training dataset contains irrelevant features (i.e., attributes), classification analysis may produce less accurate results. Data pre-processing is required to prepare the data for data mining and machine learning to increase the predictive accuracy. Feature selection is a preprocessing technique commonly used on high-dimensional data and its purposes include reducing dimensionality, removing irrelevant and redundant features, reducing the amount of data needed for learning, improving algorithms' predictive accuracy, and increasing the constructed models' comprehensibility. Much research work in data mining has gone into improving the predictive accuracy of the classifiers by applying the techniques of feature selection. The importance of feature selection in medical data mining is appreciable as the diagnosis of the disease could be done in this patient-care activity with minimum number of features. Feature selection may provide us with the means to reduce the number of clinical measures made while still maintaining or even enhancing accuracy and reducing false negative rates. In medical diagnosis, reduction in false negative rate can, literally, be the difference between life and death. In this paper we propose a feature selection approach for finding an optimum feature subset that enhances the classification accuracy of Naive Bayes classifier. Experiments were conducted on the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset to assess the effectiveness of our approach. The results confirm that SVM Ranking with Backward Search approach leads to promising improvement on feature selection and enhances classification accuracy. © 2008 IEEE.","Backward search; Classification accuracy; False negative rate; Feature selection; Predictive accuracy; SVM","Classifiers; Control theory; Cybernetics; Data mining; Data processing; Database systems; Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Support vector machines; Backward search; Classification accuracy; False negative rate; Feature selection; Predictive accuracy; SVM; Medical computing","S.

Diagnostic performance of the model for the detection of heart enlargement was assessed and compared with other deep learning methods and radiologists. CTR values derived from the deep learning method showed excellent agreement with the reference standard, with mean difference 0.0004 ± 0.0133, 95% limits of agreement -0.0256 to 0.0264. Correlation coefficient between deep learning and reference standard was 0.965 (P < 0.001), and ICC coefficient was 0.982 (95% CI 0.978-0.985) (P < 0.001). Measurement time by deep learning was significantly less than that of the manual method [0.69 (0.69-0.70) VS 25.26 (23.49-27.44) seconds, P < 0.001]. Diagnostic accuracy, specificity, and positive predictive value were comparable between the two methods. However, deep learning showed relatively higher sensitivity and negative predictive value (97.2% vs 91.4%, P = 0.004; and 96.0% vs 89.0%, P = 0.006; respectively) compared with the manual method. Performance of this computer-aided technique was demonstrated to be more reliable, time and labor saving than that of the manual method in CTR calculation. © 2013 IEEE.","cardiomegaly; deep learning; Machine learning; object segmentation; X-rays application","Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Cardiomegaly; Computer aided technique; Convolutional neural network; Correlation coefficient; Diagnostic performance; Negative predictive value; Object segmentation; Positive predictive values; Deep learning","B.

Early diagnosis of VAP is important to provide appropriate treatment and reduce mortality. Developing a noninvasive and highly accurate diagnostic method is important. The invention of electronic sensors has been applied to analyze the volatile organic compounds in breath to detect VAP using a machine learning technique. However, the process of building an algorithm is usually unclear and prevents physicians from applying the artificial intelligence technique in clinical practice. Clear processes of model building and assessing accuracy are warranted. The objective of this study was to develop a breath test for VAP with a standardized protocol for a machine learning technique. Methods: We conducted a case-control study. This study enrolled subjects in an intensive care unit of a hospital in southern Taiwan from February 2017 to June 2019. We recruited patients with VAP as the case group and ventilated patients without pneumonia as the control group. We collected exhaled breath and analyzed the electric resistance changes of 32 sensor arrays of an electronic nose. We split the data into a set for training algorithms and a set for testing. We applied eight machine learning algorithms to build prediction models, improving model performance and providing an estimated diagnostic accuracy. Results: A total of 33 cases and 26 controls were used in the final analysis. Using eight machine learning algorithms, the mean accuracy in the testing set was 0.81 ± 0.04, the sensitivity was 0.79 ± 0.08, the specificity was 0.83 ± 0.00, the positive predictive value was 0.85 ± 0.02, the negative predictive value was 0.77 ± 0.06, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves was 0.85 ± 0.04. The mean kappa value in the testing set was 0.62 ± 0.08, which suggested good agreement. Conclusions: There was good accuracy in detecting VAP by sensor array and machine learning techniques. Artificial intelligence has the potential to assist the physician in making a clinical diagnosis. Clear protocols for data processing and the modeling procedure needed to increase generalizability. © 2020 The Author(s).","Breath test; Electronic nose; Machine learning; Ventilator-associated pneumonia; Volatile organic compounds","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomedical Research; Case-Control Studies; Decision Trees; Electronic Nose; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated; Respiratory Mechanics; aged; Article; case control study; clinical article; clinical protocol; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; electric resistance; expired air; female; human; intensive care unit; learning algorithm; machine learning; male; nonhuman; prediction; predictive value; sensitivity and specificity; standardization; Taiwan; ventilator associated pneumonia; breathing mechanics; decision tree; electronic nose; machine learning; medical research; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; ventilator associated pneumonia; very elderly","H.-Y.

The identification of at risk individuals allows for preventative measures to alleviate said strain. Electronic health records provide opportunity for big data analysis to address such applications. Such data however, provides a challenging problem space for traditional statistics and machine learning due to high dimensionality and sparse data elements. This article proposes a novel machine learning methodology: entropy regularization with ensemble deep neural networks (ECNN), which simultaneously provides high predictive performance of hospitalization of patients with dementia whilst enabling an interpretable heuristic analysis of the model architecture, able to identify individual features of importance within a large feature domain space. Experimental results on health records containing 54,647 features were able to identify 10 event indicators within a patient timeline: a collection of diagnostic events, medication prescriptions and procedural events, the highest ranked being essential hypertension. The resulting subset was still able to provide a highly competitive hospitalization prediction (Accuracy: 0.759) as compared to the full feature domain (Accuracy: 0.755) or traditional feature selection techniques (Accuracy: 0.737), a significant reduction in feature size. The discovery and heuristic evidence of correlation provide evidence for further clinical study of said medical events as potential novel indicators. There also remains great potential for adaption of ECNN within other medical big data domains as a data mining tool for novel risk factor identification. © 2013 IEEE.","Deep learning; dementia; electronic health records; feature selection; hospitalization; machine learning; risk factors; weight regularization","Big data; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Heuristic methods; Hospitals; Learning systems; Medical computing; Neurodegenerative diseases; Records management; Risk assessment; Elderly populations; Electronic health record; Essential hypertension; High dimensionality; Hospital admissions; Patients with dementia; Predictive performance; Selection techniques; aged; Article; big data; clinical article; data base; data mining; deep neural network; dementia; electronic health record; entropy; essential hypertension; feature ranking; feature selection; female; heuristics; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; male; prescription; primary medical care; risk factor; social work; task performance; Data mining","X.

Laryngeal cancer, one of the most common head and neck cancers, has risen globally by 58.7%. CT, MRI and PET are acquired during the diagnostic process providing potential data for radiomic analysis and correlation with outcomes. This review aims to examine the applications of this technique to laryngeal cancer and the future considerations for translation into clinical practice. Methods: A comprehensive systematic review-informed search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was undertaken. Keywords ""laryngeal cancer""OR ""larynx""OR ""larynx cancer""OR ""head and neck cancer""were combined with ""radiomic""OR ""signature""OR ""machine learning""OR ""artificial intelligence"". Additional articles were obtained from bibliographies using the ""snowball method"". Results: The included studies (n = 15) demonstrated that radiomic features are significantly associated with various clinical outcomes (including stage, overall survival, treatment response, progression-free survival) and that predictive models incorporating radiomic features are superior to those that do not. Two studies demonstrated radiomics could improve laryngeal cancer staging whilst 12 studies affirmed its predictive capability for clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Radiomics has potential for improving multiple aspects of laryngeal cancer care; however, the heterogeneous cohorts and lack of data on laryngeal cancer exclusively inhibits firm conclusions. Large prospective well-designed studies in laryngeal cancer are required to progress this field. Furthermore, to implement radiomics into clinical practice, a unified research effort is required to standardise radiomics practice.  © 2021 The Authors.","","Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Larynx; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; cisplatin; docetaxel; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; fluorouracil; advanced cancer; area under the curve; artificial intelligence; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer control; cancer free survival; cancer palliative therapy; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer survival; chemoradiotherapy; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; clinical outcome; clinical practice; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic accuracy; distant metastasis; entropy; head and neck cancer; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; histogram; human; hypopharynx cancer; induction chemotherapy; laryngectomy; larynx cancer; machine learning; metabolic tumor volume; nomogram; outcome assessment; overall survival; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; predictive model; predictive value; primary tumor; progression free survival; radiomics; Review; systematic review; texture analysis; thyroid cartilage; treatment response; tumor volume; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; larynx; larynx tumor; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; procedures; x-ray computed tomography","A.D.

The imputation of missingness is a key step in Electronic Health Records (EHR) mining, as it can significantly affect the conclusions derived from the downstream analysis in translational medicine. The missingness of laboratory values in EHR is not at random, yet imputation techniques tend to disregard this key distinction. Consequently, the development of an adaptive imputation strategy designed specifically for EHR is an important step in improving the data imbalance and enhancing the predictive power of modeling tools for healthcare applications. Method. We analyzed the laboratory measures derived from Geisinger’s EHR on patients in three distinct cohorts—patients tested for Clostridioides difficile (Cdiff) infection, patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and patients with a diagnosis of hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA). We extracted Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) from which we excluded those with 75% or more missingness. The comorbidities, primary or secondary diagnosis, as well as active problem lists, were also extracted. The adaptive imputation strategy was designed based on a hybrid approach. The comorbidity patterns of patients were transformed into latent patterns and then clustered. Imputation was performed on a cluster of patients for each cohort independently to show the generalizability of the method. The results were compared with imputation applied to the complete dataset without incorporating the information from comorbidity patterns. Results. We analyzed a total of 67,445 patients (11,230 IBD patients, 10,000 OA patients, and 46,215 patients tested for C. difficile infection). We extracted 495 LOINC and 11,230 diagnosis codes for the IBD cohort, 8160 diagnosis codes for the Cdiff cohort, and 2042 diagnosis codes for the OA cohort based on the primary/secondary diagnosis and active problem list in the EHR. Overall, the most improvement from this strategy was observed when the laboratory measures had a higher level of missingness. The best root mean square error (RMSE) difference for each dataset was recorded as −35.5 for the Cdiff, −8.3 for the IBD, and −11.3 for the OA dataset. Conclusions. An adaptive imputation strategy designed specifically for EHR that uses complementary information from the clinical profile of the patient can be used to improve the imputation of missing laboratory values, especially when laboratory codes with high levels of missingness are included in the analysis. © 2020 by the authors.

This includes both nutritional anemias, of which iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the commonest and inherited hemolytic anemias like β thalassemias (β-TT). In Eastern and North-Eastern India about 25–40% of the public blood bank blood is consumed by patients with β Thalassemia. Moreover, 51% of Indian women in the reproductive age suffer from IDA. Most vulnerable group of anemic patients is in the rural underserved regions. This underserved population can only be served through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), automation, supported by telemedicine. To combat the problems of both IDA and β-thalassemia by early diagnosis at the point-of-care– we have developed Suśruta - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven robust smartphone-based health care application. This App uses five major components of AI; namely: (1) Natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the unstructured clinical data and translate it into computer understandable 3rd Generation SNOMED and ICD10 ontologies; (2) Speech Synthesis; (3) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ML/DL) on 60,283 labelled common blood counts (CBC) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) data collected over 8 years by a teaching hospital in Kolkata for β-TT screening; (4) Computer Vision and Image Processing techniques to interpret hemoglobin content in blood through non-invasive analysis of conjunctiva and nailbed images; and (5) NoSQL and Big-data Graph database-driven Bayesian Knowledge Network for Evidence Based Medicine and Bayesian Outcome Tracing for Predictive Medicine. Unlike previous systems, the ML/DL technique of β-Thalassemia carrier screening with CBC improved the accuracy of screening by two folds compared similar approaches analyzing CBC with Mentzer Index. Moreover, the uniqueness of Suśruta is that the App is robust and works both in an offline and online mode at resource constrained point-of-care. This is the first time AI is used for comprehensive anemia care by early diagnosis, which empowers the ordinary health workers in rural underserved communities. Furthermore, it will introduce the concept of patient empowerment and person centered care by changing the definition of point-of-care in rural India. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","AI; Anemia; ANN; Artificial Intelligence; Bayesian Knowledge Network; Bayesian Outcome Tracing; Big data; CDSS; Healthcare; ML/DL; NoSQL; Smartphone apps; Thalassemia","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Blood; Deep learning; E-learning; Health care; High performance liquid chromatography; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Machine components; Medical education; mHealth; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Rural areas; Smartphones; Speech synthesis; Anemia; Bayesian; CDSS; Knowledge networks; ML/DL; NoSQL; Smartphone apps; Thalassemia; Diagnosis","A.K.

A set of conventional ultrasound (US) and ultrasound elastography (UE) parameters are studied, and among those, the effective ones whose independent as well as combined performance is found satisfactory are selected. To improve the combined US performance, two new US parameters are proposed: edge diffusivity, which assesses edge blurriness to differentiate malignant from benign lesions, and the shape asymmetry factor, which quantifies tumor shape irregularity by comparing the tumor boundary with an ellipse fitted to the lesion. Then a new bimodal multiparameter characterization index is defined to discriminate 201 pathologically confirmed breast tumors of which 56 are malignant lesions, 79 are fibroadenomas, 42 are cysts and 24 are inflammatory lesions. The weights of the multiparameter bimodal index are optimally computed using a genetic algorithm (GA). To evaluate the performance variation of the index on different data sets, the tumors are categorized into three classes: malignant lesion versus fibroadenoma, malignant lesion versus fibroadenoma and cyst and malignant lesion versus fibroadenoma, cyst and inflammation. The test results reveal that the proposed bimodal index achieves satisfactory quality metrics (e.g., 94.64%-98.21% sensitivity, 97.24%-100.00% specificity and 96.52%-99.44% accuracy) for classification of the aforementioned three classes of breast tumors. Its performance is also observed to be better in totality of the quality metrics sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value as compared with that of a conventional bimodal index as well as unimodal multiparameter indices based on US or UE. It is suggested that the proposed simple bimodal linear classifier may assist radiologists in better diagnosis of breast tumors and help reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. © 2015 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.","B-mode indices; Bimodal indices; Breast tumor characterization; Computer-aided diagnosis; Elastographic indices; Elastography; Ultrasound","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Middle Aged; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ultrasonography, Mammary; Young Adult; Computer aided diagnosis; Genetic algorithms; Medical imaging; Tumors; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonics; Bimodal indices; Breast tumor; Elastographic indices; Elastography; Mode index; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; B scan; bimodal multiparameter index; breast biopsy; breast carcinoma; breast cyst; breast fibroadenoma; breast tumor; controlled study; conventional bimodal index; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; edge diffusivity; elastography; fine needle aspiration biopsy; genetic algorithm; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; mammography; mastitis; predictive value; priority journal; quantitative analysis; radiological parameters; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; shape asymmetry factor; tumor classification; tumor volume; unimodal multiparameter index; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; breast tumor; classification; computer assisted diagnosis; echography; echomammography; female; image enhancement; machine learning; middle aged; procedures; reproducibility; young adult; Diagnosis","M.K.

In this review, we start with an introduction to ML by providing an overview of the ML landscape, its general workflow, and the most commonly used algorithms for clinical laboratory applications. Furthermore, we aim to illustrate recent evolutions (2018 to mid-2020) of the techniques used in the clinical laboratory setting and discuss the associated challenges and opportunities. In the field of clinical chemistry, the reviewed applications of ML algorithms include quality review of lab results, automated urine sediment analysis, disease or outcome prediction from routine laboratory parameters, and interpretation of complex biochemical data. In the hematology subdiscipline, we discuss the concepts of automated blood film reporting and malaria diagnosis.

They contain relevant information, but their secondary use is almost impossible, due to their unstructured nature. Researchers are trying to address this problems, with traditional and promising novel techniques. Application in real hospital settings seems not to be possible yet, though, both because of relatively small and dirty dataset, and for the lack of language-specific pre-trained models. Aim: Our aim is to demonstrate the potential of the above techniques, but also raise awareness of the still open challenges that the scientific communities of IT and medical practitioners must jointly address to realize the full potential of unstructured content that is daily produced and digitized in hospital settings, both to improve its data quality and leverage the insights from data-driven predictive models. Methods: To this extent, we present a narrative literature review of the most recent and relevant contributions to leverage the application of Natural Language Processing techniques to the free-text content electronic patient records. In particular, we focused on four selected application domains, namely: data quality, information extraction, sentiment analysis and predictive models, and automated patient cohort selection. Then, we will present a few empirical studies that we undertook at a major teaching hospital specializing in musculoskeletal diseases.

It is observed that the use of big data architecture and techniques are continuously assisting in managing the expeditious data growth in healthcare industry. Here, initially an empirical study is performed to analyze the role of big data in healthcare industry. It has been observed that significant work has been done using big data in healthcare sector. Nowadays, it is intricate to envision the way the machine learning and big data can influence the healthcare industries. It has been observed that most of the authors who implemented the use of machine learning and big data analytics in disease diagnosis have not given significant weightage to the privacy and security of the data. Here, a novel design of smart and secure healthcare information system using machine learning and advanced security mechanism has been proposed to handle big data of medical industry. The innovation lies in the incorporation of optimal storage and data security layer used to maintain security and privacy. Different techniques like masking encryption, activity monitoring, granular access control, dynamic data encryption and end point validation have been incorporated.

It documents critical information about the patient's health and the radiologist's interpretation of medical findings. It also communicates information to the referring physicians and records that information for future clinical and research use. Although efforts to structure some radiology report information through predefined templates are beginning to bear fruit, a large portion of radiology report information is entered in free text. The free text format is a major obstacle for rapid extraction and subsequent use of information by clinicians, researchers, and healthcare information systems. This difficulty is due to the ambiguity and subtlety of natural language, complexity of described images, and variations among different radiologists and healthcare organizations. As a result, radiology reports are used only once by the clinician who ordered the study and rarely are used again for research and data mining. In this work, machine learning techniques and a large multi-institutional radiology report repository are used to extract the semantics of the radiology report and overcome the barriers to the re-use of radiology report information in clinical research and other healthcare applications. Material and methods: We describe a machine learning system to annotate radiology reports and extract report contents according to an information model. This information model covers the majority of clinically significant contents in radiology reports and is applicable to a wide variety of radiology study types. Our automated approach uses discriminative sequence classifiers for named-entity recognition to extract and organize clinically significant terms and phrases consistent with the information model. We evaluated our information extraction system on 150 radiology reports from three major healthcare organizations and compared its results to a commonly used non-machine learning information extraction method. We also evaluated the generalizability of our approach across different organizations by training and testing our system on data from different organizations. Results: Our results show the efficacy of our machine learning approach in extracting the information model's elements (10-fold cross-validation average performance: precision: 87%, recall: 84%, F1 score: 85%) and its superiority and generalizability compared to the common non-machine learning approach (p-value < 0.05). Conclusions: Our machine learning information extraction approach provides an effective automatic method to annotate and extract clinically significant information from a large collection of free text radiology reports. This information extraction system can help clinicians better understand the radiology reports and prioritize their review process. In addition, the extracted information can be used by researchers to link radiology reports to information from other data sources such as electronic health records and the patient's genome. Extracted information also can facilitate disease surveillance, real-time clinical decision support for the radiologist, and content-based image retrieval. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Discriminative sequence classifier; Information extraction; Natural language processing; Radiology report narrative","Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Discriminant Analysis; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Machine Learning; Medical Record Linkage; Models, Theoretical; Natural Language Processing; Observer Variation; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiology Information Systems; Reproducibility of Results; Semantics; United States; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Content based retrieval; Data mining; Decision support systems; Health care; Image retrieval; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Information systems; Information theory; Information use; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Natural language processing systems; Radiation; Radiology; Semantics; Societies and institutions; Content based image retrieval; Health care information system; Information extraction methods; Information extraction systems; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Radiology reports; Article; clinical data repository; clinical research; conditional markov model; conditional random field model; data extraction; documentation; health care organization; human; information model; information retrieval; machine learning; measurement precision; medical documentation; medical illustration; medical information; named entity recognition; natural language processing; priority journal; radiology report; semantics; automated pattern recognition; clinical trial; computer assisted diagnosis; data mining; discriminant analysis; electronic health record; factual database; medical record; multicenter study; observer variation; predictive value; procedures; radiology information system; reproducibility; semantics; theoretical model; United States; Classification (of information)","S.

A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which “learns” intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (“explainable AI”). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce. © The Author(s) 2020.","decision-making; deep learning; dental; diagnostic systems; informatics; machine learning","Artificial Intelligence; Dentistry; Forecasting; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; artificial intelligence; dentistry; forecasting; human; image processing","F.

This neurological disorder can persist throughout the lifetime of patients and impacts their quality of life significantly. Identification of markers that indicate the likelihood of developing PTE can help develop preventive care for subjects identified as at risk. Despite the relatively high prevalence of PTE, brain imaging-based biomarkers for the diagnosis of PTE are lacking. This is due in part to the heterogeneity of injury in traumatic brain injury patients. Here we investigate the use of structural and functional imaging features for training machine learning models. Recently, applying state of the art machine learning methods such as neural networks on clinical data to help diagnosis attract a considerable amount of attention. However, the choice of a good algorithm and subset of features is fundamental to achieve reliable classification. Our goal is to explore if different Machine Learning techniques could be leveraged for the early diagnosis of PTE. We compared four popular machine learning methods performance to predict PTE after brain injury (1) support vector machine and (2) random forest (3) fully connected neural network and (4) graph convolutional network. Our result demonstrates the advantage of using a combination of connectivity features (functional) and lesion volume (structural) in conjunction with a Kernel SVM approach in predicting PTE. We also shown using a feature reduction method such as principal component analysis (PCA) is more effective than penalizing the classifiers. This might be due to the limitation of penalized models for a framework where features are correlatedPost-Traumatic Epilepsy is one of the common aftereffects of brain injury. This neurological disorder can persist throughout the lifetime of patients and impacts their quality of life significantly. Identification of markers that indicate the likelihood of developing PTE can help develop preventive care for subjects identified as at risk. Despite the relatively high prevalence of PTE, brain imaging-based biomarkers for the diagnosis of PTE are lacking. This is due in part to the heterogeneity of injury in traumatic brain injury patients. Here we investigate the use of structural and functional imaging features for training machine learning models. Recently, applying state of the art machine learning methods such as neural networks on clinical data to help diagnosis attract a considerable amount of attention. However, the choice of a good algorithm and subset of features is fundamental to achieve reliable classification. Our goal is to explore if different Machine Learning techniques could be leveraged for the early diagnosis of PTE. We compared four popular machine learning methods performance to predict PTE after brain injury (1) support vector machine and (2) random forest (3) fully connected neural network and (4) graph convolutional network. Our result demonstrates the advantage of using a combination of connectivity features (functional) and lesion volume (structural) in conjunction with a Kernel SVM approach in predicting PTE. We also shown using a feature reduction method such as principal component analysis (PCA) is more effective than penalizing the classifiers. This might be due to the limitation of penalized models for a framework where features are correlated.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This has also prompted increasing interests in the generation of analytical, data driven models based on machine learning in health informatics. Deep learning, a technique with its foundation in artificial neural networks, is emerging in recent years as a powerful tool for machine learning, promising to reshape the future of artificial intelligence. Rapid improvements in computational power, fast data storage, and parallelization have also contributed to the rapid uptake of the technology in addition to its predictive power and ability to generate automatically optimized high-level features and semantic interpretation from the input data. This article presents a comprehensive up-to-date review of research employing deep learning in health informatics, providing a critical analysis of the relative merit, and potential pitfalls of the technique as well as its future outlook.

As the number of COVID-19 cases soars in epicenters, health officials are warning about the possibility of the designated treatment centers being overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. In this study, several computational techniques are implemented to analyze the survival characteristics of 1,182 patients. The computational results agree with the outcome reported in early clinical reports released for a group of patients from China that confirmed a higher mortality rate in men compared with women and in older age groups. The discharge-time prediction of COVID-19 patients was also evaluated using different machine-learning and statistical analysis methods. The results indicate that the Gradient Boosting survival model outperforms other models for patient survival prediction in this study. This research study is aimed to help health officials make more educated decisions during the outbreak. A record-breaking pressure has been placed on healthcare systems by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of fast-growing requests for medical care in hospitals, with limited space and number of intensive care units, estimation of the length of stay of patients with COVID-19 in hospitals can provide insightful information to decision makers for efficient allocation of equipment and managing hospital overload in different countries. This work introduces statistical models and machine-learning-based approaches that can be directly applied to real-world COVID-19 data to predict the patient discharge time from hospital and evaluate how the patient clinical information could have an impact on the length of stay in hospital. While considerable insights have been achieved about the patient recovery times in this paper, applications of these data-driven approaches are expected to gather substantial interest in the near future once more detailed clinical data are available. COVID-19 has spread to many countries in a short period, and overwhelmed hospitals can be a direct consequence of rapidly increasing coronavirus cases. In this study, by choosing patient discharge time as the event of interest, survival analysis techniques including statistical analysis and machine-learning approaches are used to build predictive models capable of predicting patients’ period of stay in hospital. This time is crucial because it allows decision makers to be prepared for hospital overloads. © 2020 The Authors","artificial intelligence; biostatistic; coronavirus; COVID-19; DSML 5: Mainstream: Data science output is well understood and (nearly) universally adopted; machine learning; pandemic; statistical analysis; survival analysis","Bioinformatics; Decision making; Forecasting; Intensive care units; Machine learning; Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Population statistics; Clinical information; Computational results; Computational technique; Data-driven approach; Efficient allocations; Health-care system; Machine learning approaches; Statistical analysis methods; Predictive analytics","M.

There have been significant breakthroughs in using Predictive Analytics in healthcare where it is held as the foundation of precision medicine. Yet, although the research in the field is expanding with the profuse volume of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries.

Of various machine-learning techniques, sparse regression models have proved their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data but with a small number of training samples, especially in medical problems. In the meantime, deep learning methods have been making great successes by outperforming the state-of-the-art performances in various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the two conceptually different methods of sparse regression and deep learning for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, we first train multiple sparse regression models, each of which is trained with different values of a regularization control parameter. Thus, our multiple sparse regression models potentially select different feature subsets from the original feature set; thereby they have different powers to predict the response values, i.e., clinical label and clinical scores in our work. By regarding the response values from our sparse regression models as target-level representations, we then build a deep convolutional neural network for clinical decision making, which thus we call ‘Deep Ensemble Sparse Regression Network.’ To our best knowledge, this is the first work that combines sparse regression models with deep neural network. In our experiments with the ADNI cohort, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving the highest diagnostic accuracies in three classification tasks. We also rigorously analyzed our results and compared with the previous studies on the ADNI cohort in the literature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alzheimer's disease; Convolutional neural network; Deep ensemble learning; Sparse regression model","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Clinical Decision-Making; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prognosis; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Brain mapping; Clustering algorithms; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Medical problems; Neurodegenerative diseases; Regression analysis; Alzheimer's disease; Clinical decision making; Diagnosis and prognosis; Ensemble learning; High dimensional data; Machine learning techniques; Sparse regression; State-of-the-art performance; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain disease; clinical decision making; clinical effectiveness; deep ensemble learning; female; human; learning algorithm; major clinical study; male; mathematical computing; mild cognitive impairment; nerve cell network; predictive value; priority journal; prognosis; regression analysis; scoring system; sparse regression model; brain; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; machine learning; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Deep learning","H.-I.

The snowstorm of data now available to the clinician defies qualitative evaluation; the heterogeneity of data types complicates integration through traditional statistical methods; and the large datasets becoming available remain far from the big-data sizes necessary for fully data-driven machine-learning approaches. The recent emergence of data-driven disease progression models provides a balance between imposed knowledge of disease features and patterns learned from data. The resulting models are both predictive of disease progression in individual patients and informative in terms of revealing underlying biological patterns. Recent findings Largely inspired by observational models, data-driven disease progression models have emerged in the last few years as a feasible means for understanding the development of neurodegenerative diseases. These models have revealed insights into frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and other conditions. For example, event-based models have revealed finer graded understanding of progression patterns; self-modelling regression and differential equation models have provided data-driven biomarker trajectories; spatiotemporal models have shown that brain shape changes, for example of the hippocampus, can occur before detectable neurodegeneration; and network models have provided some support for prion-like mechanistic hypotheses of disease propagation. The most mature results are in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, in large part because of the availability of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative dataset. Results generally support the prevailing amyloid-led hypothetical model of Alzheimer's disease, while revealing finer detail and insight into disease progression. Summary The emerging field of disease progression modelling provides a natural mechanism to integrate different kinds of information, for example from imaging, serum and cerebrospinal fluid markers and cognitive tests, to obtain new insights into progressive diseases. Such insights include fine-grained longitudinal patterns of neurodegeneration, from early stages, and the heterogeneity of these trajectories over the population. More pragmatically, such models enable finer precision in patient staging and stratification, prediction of progression rates and earlier and better identification of at-risk individuals. We argue that this will make disease progression modelling invaluable for recruitment and end-points in future clinical trials, potentially ameliorating the high failure rate in trials of, e.g., Alzheimer's disease therapies. We review the state of the art in these techniques and discuss the future steps required to translate the ideas to front-line application. © 2017 The Author(s).","Ageing; Alzheimer; computational; disease progression; generative; modelling; multiple sclerosis; neurodegeneration; neurological; prion; statistical","Computer Simulation; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Neurological; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neuroimaging; biological marker; bioinformatics; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical feature; cognitive defect; degenerative disease; disease course; disease model; futurology; human; information processing; information technology; knowledge; medical information; neuroimaging; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; qualitative research; Review; statistical analysis; translational research; trend study; biological model; computer simulation; degenerative disease; diagnostic imaging; neuroimaging; pathology; procedures","D.C.

With increase in the volume of data generated in the healthcare industry, more wellness monitoring is required. A cloud-enabled analysis of healthcare data that predicts patient risk factors is required. Machine learning techniques have been developed to address these medical care problems. A novel technique called the radix-trie-based Tanimoto kernel regressive infomax boost classification (RT-TKRIBC) technique is introduced to analyze the heterogeneous health data in the cloud to predict the health risks and send alerts. The infomax boost ensemble technique improves the prediction accuracy by finding the maximum mutual information, thereby minimizing the mean square error. The performance evaluation of the proposed RT-TKRIBC technique is realized through extensive simulations in the cloud environment, which provides better prediction accuracy and less prediction time than those provided by the state-of-the-art methods. © The Korea Institute of Information and Communication Engineering","Cloud; Healthcare heterogeneous data; Internet of things; Predictive analytics; Radix trie","","V.R.

Different algorithms have been explored by medical practitioners in an attempt to assist their work; the diagnosis of breast cancer is one of those applications. Machine learning algorithms are of vital importance to many medical problems, they can help to diagnose a disease, to detect its causes, to predict the outcome of a treatment, etc. K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN) is one of the simplest algorithms; it is widely used in predictive analysis. To optimize its performance and to accelerate its process, this paper proposes a new solution to speed up KNN algorithm based on clustering and attributes filtering. It also includes another improvement based on reliability coefficients which insures a more accurate classification. Thus, the contributions of this paper are three-fold: (i) the clustering of class instances, (ii) the selection of most significant attributes, and (iii) the ponderation of similarities by reliability coefficients. Results of the proposed approach exceeded most known classification techniques with an average f-measure exceeding 94% on the considered breast-cancer Dataset. © 2018 The Authors.

The goal is to automatically classify lung cancer patients into groups based on clinically measurable disease-specific variables in order to estimate survival. Variables selected as inputs for machine learning include Number of Primaries, Age, Grade, Tumor Size, Stage, and TNM, which are numeric or can readily be converted to numeric type. Minimal up-front processing of the data enables exploring the out-of-the-box capabilities of established unsupervised learning techniques, with little human intervention through the entire process. The output of the techniques is used to predict survival time, with the efficacy of the prediction representing a proxy for the usefulness of the classification. A basic single variable linear regression against each unsupervised output is applied, and the associated Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value is calculated as a metric to compare between the outputs. The results show that self-ordering maps exhibit the best performance, while k-Means performs the best of the simpler classification techniques. Predicting against the full data set, it is found that their respective RMSE values (15.591 for self-ordering maps and 16.193 for k-Means) are comparable to supervised regression techniques, such as Gradient Boosting Machine (RMSE of 15.048). We conclude that unsupervised data analysis techniques may be of use to classify patients by defining the classes as effective proxies for survival prediction. © 2017 Lynch et al.

These data can be mined through computational analysis and models to identify predictive image biomarkers that characterize intra-tumoral dynamics throughout the course of treatment. This is particularly difficult in gliomas, where heterogeneity has been well established at a molecular level as well as visually in conventional imaging. Thus, acquiring clinically useful features remains difficult due to temporal variations in tumor dynamics. Identifying surrogate biomarkers through radiomics may provide a non-invasive means of characterizing biologic activities of gliomas. We present an extensive literature review of radiomics-based analysis, with a particular focus on computational modeling, machine learning, and fractal-based analysis in improving differential diagnosis and predicting clinical outcomes. Novel strategies in extracting quantitative features, segmentation methods, and their clinical applications are producing promising results. Moreover, we provide a detailed summary of the morphometric parameters that have so far been proposed as a means of quantifying imaging characteristics of gliomas. Newly emerging radiomic techniques via machine learning and fractal-based analyses holds considerable potential for improving diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of gliomas. Key points • Radiomic features can be mined through computational analysis to produce quantitative imaging biomarkers that characterize intra-tumoral dynamics throughout the course of treatment. • Surrogate image biomarkers identified through radiomics could enable a non-invasive means of characterizing biologic activities of gliomas. • With novel analytic algorithms, quantification of morphological or sub-regional tumor features to predict survival outcomes is producing promising results. • Quantifying intra-tumoral heterogeneity may improve grading and molecular sub-classifications of gliomas. • Computational fractal-based analysis of gliomas allows geometrical evaluation of tumor irregularities and complexity, leading to novel techniques for tumor segmentation, grading, and therapeutic monitoring. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Computational modeling; Fractal analysis; Glioma; Machine learning; Radiomics","Biomarkers; Brain Neoplasms; Diagnosis, Differential; Fractals; Glioma; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Neuroimaging; biological marker; big data; brain tumor; cancer classification; cancer prognosis; clinical feature; clinical outcome; computer model; differential diagnosis; fractal analysis; glioma; human; image segmentation; machine learning; morphometry; priority journal; radiologist; radiomics; Review; survival prediction; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; fractal analysis; glioma; machine learning; neuroimaging; procedures","A.

The purpose of this study is to use machine learning to identify clinical phenotypes for critically ill patients with MV in intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 5013 patients who had undergone MV and treatment in the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Statistical and machine learning methods were used. All the data used in this study, including demographics, vital signs, circulation parameters and mechanical ventilator parameters, etc., were automatically extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) system. An external database, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III), was used for validation. Results: Phenotypes were derived from a total of 4009 patients who underwent MV using a latent profile analysis of 22 variables. The associations between the phenotypes and disease severity and clinical outcomes were assessed. Another 1004 patients in the database were enrolled for validation. Of the five derived phenotypes, phenotype I was the most common subgroup (n = 2174; 54.2%) and was mostly composed of the postoperative population. Phenotype II (n = 480; 12.0%) led to the most severe conditions. Phenotype III (n = 241; 6.01%) was associated with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and low mean airway pressure. Phenotype IV (n = 368; 9.18%) was associated with high driving pressure, and younger patients comprised a large proportion of the phenotype V group (n = 746; 18.6%). In addition, we found that the mortality rate of Phenotype IV was significantly higher than that of the other phenotypes. In this subgroup, the number of patients in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score segment (9,22] was 198, the number of deaths was 88, and the mortality rate was higher than 44%. However, the cumulative 28-day mortality of Phenotypes IV and II, which were 101 of 368 (27.4%) and 87 of 480 (18.1%) unique patients, respectively, was significantly higher than those of the other phenotypes. There were consistent phenotype distributions and differences in biomarker patterns by phenotype in the validation cohort, and external verification with MIMIC III further generated supportive results. Conclusions: Five clinical phenotypes were correlated with different disease severities and clinical outcomes, which suggested that these phenotypes may help in understanding heterogeneity in MV treatment effects. © 2020, The Author(s).","Clinical phenotype; Critically ill patients; Machine learning; Mechanical ventilation","Adult; Aged; Critical Illness; Databases, Factual; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Health Status; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Lung; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Respiration, Artificial; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury; biological marker; adult; airway pressure; Article; artificial ventilation; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; critically ill patient; data base; disease severity; human; intensive care unit; machine learning; major clinical study; mortality rate; positive pressure ventilation; retrospective study; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; survivor; validation study; adverse event; aged; critical illness; decision support system; factual database; female; health status; lung; male; middle aged; mortality; pathophysiology; phenotype; predictive value; reproducibility; risk assessment; risk factor; treatment outcome; ventilator induced lung injury","Y.

EHRs are not anymore used, as in the past, to store basic information of the patient and administrative tasks, but they may include a range of data, including the medical history of the patient, laboratory test results, demographics, medication and allergies, immunization status, radiology images, vital signs. At the present, the problem has shifted from collecting massive amounts of data to understanding it, i.e. use EHRs for turning data into knowledge, conclusions and actions. EHRs were not designed to forecast disease risk or disease progression or to determine the right treatment, but if they are combined with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm this issue became possible. The need for tools allowing to construct predictive models capturing disease progression is a priority. In the recent past EHRs were analyzed using traditional machine learning techniques, whereas recently the progress in the field of deep learning let to the application of deep learning techniques to EHRs.

Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, 600048, India","Presently, the application of machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) techniques have a vital role in healthcare systems and wisely convert all obtainable data into beneficial knowledge. It is proven from the literature works that a chance of 12% error remains in the diagnosis of the diseases by the medical practitioners. Moreover, for effective disease risk prediction in medical analysis, more emphasis is accorded to the area under the curve (AUC) with accuracy as an evaluation metric. However, the role of the AUC has not been previously characterized notably. In this research article, a novel feature reduction (NFR) model that is aligned with the ML and DM algorithms is proposed to reduce the error rate and further improve the performance. The proposed NFR model comprises of two approaches and uses the AUC in addition to the accuracy to achieve a robust and effective disease risk prediction. The first approach is based on a heuristic process evaluating performance by reducing features with respect to the improvement in the AUC besides the accuracy as evaluation metrics, working to obtain the best subset of highly contributing features in the prediction. The second approach evaluates the accuracy and AUC of all individual features and forms the subsets with the highest accuracies, AUCs, and least difference between them, which are combined in various combinations to achieve the best-reduced set of highly relevant features. For this purpose, the benchmarked public heart datasets of the ML repository of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) are tested; the results are promising. The highest accuracy and AUC achieved with the proposed NFR model are 95.52% and 99.20% with 41.67% feature reduction, respectively. The accuracy is 4.22% higher than recent existing research with a significant improvement of 25% in the performance of the running time of the algorithm. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Methods: The application was developed and tested using data collected in a Brazilian hospital. The available data were used to feed an ML pipeline that was designed to create a simulator capable of predicting the outcome (death probability) for newborns admitted to neonatal intensive care units. However, unlike previous scoring systems, our computational tool is not intended to be used at the patients bedside, although it is possible. Our primary goal is to deliver a computational system to aid medical research in understanding the correlation of key variables with the studied outcome so that new standards can be established for future clinical decisions. In the implemented simulation environment, the values of key attributes can be changed using a user-friendly interface, where the impact of each change on the outcome is immediately reported, allowing a quantitative analysis, in addition to a qualitative investigation, and delivering a totally interactive computational tool that facilitates hypothesis construction and testing. Results: Our statistical experiments showed that the resulting model for death prediction could achieve an accuracy of 86.7% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 for the positive class. Using this model, three physicians and a neonatal nutritionist performed simulations with key variables correlated with chance of death. The results indicated important tendencies for the effect of each variable and the combination of variables on prognosis. We could also observe values of gestational age and birth weight for which a low Apgar score and the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) could be less or more severe. For instance, we have noticed that for a newborn with 2000 g or more the occurrence of RDS is far less problematic than for neonates weighing less. Conclusions: The significant accuracy demonstrated by our predictive model shows that NICeSim might be used for hypothesis testing to minimize in vivo experiments. We observed that the model delivers predictions that are in very good agreement with the literature, demonstrating that NICeSim might be an important tool for supporting decision making in medical practice. Other very important characteristics of NICeSim are its flexibility and dynamism. NICeSim is flexible because it allows the inclusion and deletion of variables according to the requirements of a particular study. It is also dynamic because it trains a just-in-time model. Therefore, the system is improved as data from new patients become available. Finally, NICeSim can be extended in a cooperative manner because it is an open-source system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..","Artificial neural networks; Clinical decision making; Machine learning in medicine; Perinatal care; Prenatal care; Support vector machine","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical Research; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Support Vector Machines; Clinical research; Computational methods; Decision making; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Intensive care units; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Open systems; Simulators; Support vector machines; Clinical decision making; Neonatal intensive care units; Perinatal care; Prenatal care; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Respiratory distress syndrome; Statistical experiments; User friendly interface; algorithm; artificial intelligence; decision making; female; human; medical research; pregnancy; prenatal care; support vector machine; Learning systems","","","Elsevier B.V.","09333657","","AIMEE","25457563","English","Artif.

The problem of class imbalance arises when the distribution of samples across the known classes is skewed. It affects the performance of robust machine learning algorithms. The performance evaluation parameters used to measure the machine learning models are also very important in the case of class imbalanced datasets. This paper critically evaluates the performance of random forest classifier for the application of seizure state recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) data. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to balance the EEG dataset. Parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, false positive rate (FPR), f1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) are considered for evaluation and analysis of the performance of actual class imbalanced dataset and class balanced dataset using SMOTE. The results indicate that the effect of balancing class does not affect the accuracy of the model much, however, it improves the sensitivity and AUC parameters significantly; which are the important parameters in case of measuring the predictive performance of class imbalanced dataset. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Class imbalance; Electroencephalography (EEG); Machine learning; Random forest; Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)","Balancing; Decision trees; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Learning algorithms; Class imbalance; Electroencephalography; Evaluation parameters; Imbalanced dataset; Machine learning algorithms; Performance; Performances evaluation; Random forests; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Synthetic minority oversampling technique; Machine learning","V.

Even if human decision-making is frequently most advantageous, but it is poor when there are vast amounts of data to be classified. Also capability and accuracy of decisions will decrease when humans are set into pressure and massive work. Forever there is a need and scope for a better MDSS. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Cluster analysis is a method of grouping of objects keen on different groups, has proved to be a valuable tool for identifying co-expressed genes, biologically related groupings of genes and patterns. K-means, Hierarchical and Fuzzy c-means are various clustering techniques have been employed to work as core part of MDSS. Findings: Proposed Weighted Class Based Clustering (WCBC) method is dependent on classifying properties of medical data itself. Weights are calculated on the basis of class value consequently increases separability by placing more number of instances of same class in same cluster. In this paper, the clustering algorithms K-means, Hierarchical, Fuzzy and Weighted Class based K-Means are examined for medical domains. Our finding is that on medical domains the Proposed Weighted Class Based Clustering outperforms others. Application/Improvements: The application of Proposed Weighted Class Based Clustering on medical datasets gave an insight into predictive ability of Machine Learning in medical diagnosis and there is a wide liberty that proposed approach can be used in RBF Neural Network for center calculation and data base Kernel Learning which is open area of research these days.","Clustering; Fuzzy; Hierarchical; K-Means; MDSS; Weighted Class Based Clustering","","S.

The increasing computational power makes it capable to handle large amounts of data without much human interactions. The successful applications of the most popular DL models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoder (AEs), deep belief network (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in various supervised and unsupervised tasks have opened doors to many information processing tasks. In recent years, the use of DL technique has helped in solving many healthcare-related problems. The capability of handling various types of data and providing abstract representation made DL one of the prominent tools to perform predictive analysis tasks in a disease like diabetes mellitus (DM). We have realized that a detailed discussion is required on these models along with their applications in various problem domains. This will help readers to understand their requirements in advancing health care. In this chapter, we have tried to cover each of the models and figure out how they handle various types of data in medical the domain and made our work easier. This leads us to the discussion on one of the most common diseases in the world “diabetes mellitus,” which causes serious complications in the long run if diagnosis and various management measures are not taken on time.

For a long time it has required extensive involvement of a human expert. However, recent progress in data mining techniques, especially in machine learning, allows for creating decision models and support systems that help to automatize this task and provide clinicians with patient-specific therapeutic and diagnostic suggestions. In this paper,we describe a study aimed at building a decision model (a classifier) that would predict the type of treatment (surgical vs. non-surgical) for patients with bone fractures based on their X-ray images. We consider two types of features extracted from images (structural and textural) and used them to construct multiple classifiers that are later evaluated in a computational experiment. Structural features are computed by applying the Hough transform, while textural information is obtained from gray-level occurrence matrix (GLCM). In research reported by other authors structural and textural features were typically considered separately. Our findings show that while structural features have better predictive capabilities, they can benefit from combining them with textural ones. Interestingly, there are no statistical differences in overall classification accuracy attained by the classifiers considered in the study (it ranges from 91.0% to 96.1%), however, the most promising one is the random forest. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Classification models; Clinical data; Decision support; X-ray images","Bone; Data handling; Data mining; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Fracture; Hough transforms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Surgery; X ray analysis; Classification accuracy; Classification models; Clinical data; Clinical decision making; Computational experiment; Decision supports; Statistical differences; X-ray image; Big data","","Wrembel R.; Song II.-Y.; Abello A.","CEUR-WS","16130073","","","","English","CEUR Workshop Proc.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044259744"

In this area, scalable lab-on - A-chip (LOC) devices have many advantages over standard laboratory methods, including faster analysis, reduced cost, lower power consumption, and higher levels of integration and automation. Despite significant advances in LOC technologies over the years, several remaining obstacles are preventing clinical implementation and market penetration of these novel medical microdevices. Similarly, while machine learning has seen explosive growth in recent years and promises to shift the practice of medicine toward data-intensive and evidence-based decision making, its uptake has been hindered due to the lack of integration between clinical measurements and disease determinations.In this Account, we describe recent developments in the programmable bio-nanochip (p-BNC) system, a biosensor platform with the capacity for learning. The p-BNC is a ""platform to digitize biology"" in which small quantities of patient sample generate immunofluorescent signal on agarose bead sensors that is optically extracted and converted to antigen concentrations. The platform comprises disposable microfluidic cartridges, a portable analyzer, automated data analysis software, and intuitive mobile health interfaces. The single-use cartridges are fully integrated, self-contained microfluidic devices containing aqueous buffers conveniently embedded for POC use. A novel fluid delivery method was developed to provide accurate and repeatable flow rates via actuation of the cartridge's blister packs. A portable analyzer instrument was designed to integrate fluid delivery, optical detection, image analysis, and user interface, representing a universal system for acquiring, processing, and managing clinical data while overcoming many of the challenges facing the widespread clinical adoption of LOC technologies. We demonstrate the p-BNC's flexibility through the completion of multiplex assays within the single-use disposable cartridges for three clinical applications: prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute myocardial infarction.Toward the goal of creating ""sensors that learn"", we have developed and describe here the Cardiac ScoreCard, a clinical decision support system for a spectrum of cardiovascular disease. The Cardiac ScoreCard approach comprises a comprehensive biomarker panel and risk factor information in a predictive model capable of assessing early risk and late-stage disease progression for heart attack and heart failure patients. These marker-driven tests have the potential to radically reduce costs, decrease wait times, and introduce new options for patients needing regular health monitoring. Further, these efforts demonstrate the clinical utility of fusing data from information-rich biomarkers and the Internet of Things (IoT) using predictive analytics to generate single-index assessments for wellness/illness status. By promoting disease prevention and personalized wellness management, tools of this nature have the potential to improve health care exponentially. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","","Area Under Curve; Biomarkers; Biosensing Techniques; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cell Phone; Creatine Kinase, MB Form; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Limit of Detection; Nanotechnology; Point-of-Care Systems; ROC Curve; Troponin I; biological marker; creatine kinase MB; troponin I; area under the curve; cardiovascular disease; devices; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; genetic procedures; human; lab on a chip; limit of detection; mobile phone; nanotechnology; point of care system; procedures; receiver operating characteristic","J.T.

Critical to the effective use of this technology is the development of reliable algorithms to predict the potency and selectivity of siRNAs under study. Existing algorithms are mostly built upon sequence information of siRNAs and then employ statistical pattern recognition or machine learning techniques to derive rules or models. However, sequence-based features have limited ability to characterize siRNAs, especially chemically modified ones. In this study, we proposed a cheminformatics approach to describe siRNAs. Principal component scores (z1, z2, z3, z4) have been derived for each of the 5 nucleotides (A, U, G, C, T) from the descriptor matrix computed by the MOE program. Descriptors of a given siRNA sequence are simply the concatenation of the z values of its composing nucleotides. hus, for each of the 2431 siRNA sequences in the Huesken dataset, 76 descriptors were generated for the 19-NT representation, and 84 descriptors were generated for the 21-NT representation of siRNAs. Support Vector Machine regression (SVMR) was employed to develop predictive models. In all cases, the models achieved Pearson correlation coefficient r and R about 0.84 and 0.65 for the training sets and test sets, respectively. A minimum of 25% of the whole dataset was needed to obtain predictive models that could accurately predict 75% of the remaining siRNAs. Thus, for the first time, a cheminformatics approach has been developed to successfully model the structure-potency relationship in siRNA-based gene silencing data, which has laid a solid foundation for quantitative modeling of chemically modified siRNAs. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

One of the critics on machine learning is that it doesn't outperform more traditional statistical approaches in every problem. Methods and Results: Authors of “Predictive Abilities of Machine Learning Techniques May Be Limited by Dataset Characteristics: Insights From the UNOS Database” presented in the current issue of the Journal of Cardiac Failure that machine learning approaches do not provide significantly higher performance when compared to more traditional statistical approaches in predicting mortality following heart transplant. In this brief report, we provide an insight on the possible reasons for why machine learning methods do not outperform more traditional approaches for every problem and every dataset. Conclusions: Most of the performance-focused critics on machine learning are because the bar is set unfairly too high for machine learning. In most cases, machine learning methods provides at least as good results as traditional statistical methods do. It is normal for machine learning models to provide similar performance with linear models if the actual underlying input-outcome relationship is linear. Moreover, machine learning methods outperforms linear statistical models when the underlying input-output relationship is not linear and if the dataset is large enough and include predictors capturing that nonlinear relationship. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Heart transplant; Machine learning; UNOS","Databases, Factual; Heart Failure; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Statistical; biological marker; cardiovascular mortality; data base; Editorial; electronic medical record; genomics; heart failure; heart transplantation; high risk patient; hospital readmission; human; intensive care unit; machine learning; medical information; prediction; priority journal; recurrence risk; safety net hospital; scientific literature; social determinants of health; statistical analysis; statistical model; factual database; heart failure; machine learning","O.G.U.Z.

While most machine learning algorithms are complicated in code, theses labs and individual researchers could accomplish iterative data analysis using different machine learning techniques if they had access to highly available machine learning components and powerful computational infrastructures. In this contribution, we provide a comparison of several state-of-the-art Machine Learning-as-a-Service platforms along with their capabilities in medical informatics.

They are underneath massive stress to predict health concerns of clients and to create excess premium holders which will at the same time diminish the cost. Patient's readmission is often costly and shows shortfalls in the healthcare organizations. The cost of readmitted patients goes beyond 250 million dollars every year nationwide. Several healthcare agencies have started adopting Data Mining and Predictive Analysis. Predictive analysis involves various statistical techniques from modeling, machine learning, and data mining that breaks down past and present realism to forecasts the future. Henceforth, this paper is intended to propose a technique combining Apache Spark and deep learning based stacked ensemble method as a hybrid approach for predicting the readmission possibilities. Paper also focuses upon risk vindication strategies to predict patients with readmission possibility. This is implemented by considering medical data and estimating risk related using stacked machine learning techniques. With the application of such a framework that can satisfactorily classify the patient with readmission chance will help the healthcare companies to bestow top quality on healthcare systems. This technique helps achieve higher predictive accuracy of 90.69 % and RMSE score of 0.2521. Our empirical investigation demonstrates that this approach is helpful and can profit future research in the healthcare industry. © 2018 IEEE.","Apache Spark; Big data; Deep Learning; EMR (electronic medical records); HealthCare; Los (length of stay); machine learning; readmission; stacked ensemble","Big data; Data mining; Forecasting; Green computing; Health care; Internet of things; Learning systems; Machine learning; Medical computing; Predictive analytics; Risk perception; Electronic medical record; Empirical investigation; Healthcare organizations; Length of stay; Machine learning techniques; readmission; stacked ensemble; Statistical techniques; Deep learning","","C K.; K.

In order to make AM suitable for the medical, aerospace, and automotive industries, geometry variations should be controlled and managed with a tight tolerance range. In the previously published article, the authors used statistical analysis to develop linear models for the prediction of dimensional features of laser-sintered specimens. Two identical builds with the same material, process, and build parameters were produced, resulting in 434 samples for mechanical testing (ISO 527-2 1BA). The developed linear models had low accuracy, and therefore needed an application of more advanced data analysis techniques. In this work, machine learning techniques are applied for the same data, and results are compared with the previously reported linear models. The linear regression model is the best for width. Multilayer perceptron and gradient boost regressor models have outperformed other for thickness and length.

However, graph super-resolution is strikingly lacking, i.e., the concept of super-resolving low-resolution (LR) graphs with nr nodes into high-resolution graphs (HR) with nr>nr nodes. Particularly, learning how to automatically generate HR brain connectomes, without resorting to the computationally expensive MRI processing steps such as image registration and parcellation, remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose the first technique to super-resolve undirected fully connected graphs with application to brain connectomes. First, we root our brain graph super-resolution (BGSR) framework in learning how to estimate a centered LR population-based brain graph representation, coined as connectional brain template (CBT), acting as a proxy in the target BGSR task. Specifically, we hypothesize that the estimation of a well-representative and centered CBT would help better capture the individuality of each LR brain graph via its residual distance from the population-based CBT. This will eventually allow an accurate identification of the most similar individual graphs to a new testing graph in the LR domain for the target prediction task. Second, we leverage the estimated LR CBT (i.e., population mean) to derive residual LR brain graphs, capturing the deviation of all subjects from the estimated CBT. Third, we learn multi-topology LR graph manifolds using different graph topological measurements (e.g., degree, closeness, betweenness) by estimating residual LR similarity matrices modeling the relationship between pairs of residual LR graphs. These are then fused so we can effectively identify for each testing LR subject its most K similar training LR graphs. Last, the missing testing HR graph is predicted by averaging the HR graphs of the K selected training subjects. Predicted HR from LR functional brain graphs boosted classification results for autistic subjects by 16.48% compared with LR functional graphs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Brain connectomes; Brain graph fusion; Connectional brain template learning; Graph super-resolution; Neurological disorder diagnosis; Topology-based residual graph manifold learning","Autistic Disorder; Brain; Connectome; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Nervous System Diseases; Diagnosis; Dimensionality reduction; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Magnetic resonance imaging; Optical resolving power; Pattern recognition; Classification results; Embedding technique; Functional graphs; Graph representation; Medical data analysis; Neurological disorders; Similar individuals; Target prediction; Article; autism; brain graph super resolution; connectional brain template; connectome; data analysis; dimensionality reduction; feature extraction; feature selection; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; image analysis; image processing; imaging algorithm; machine learning; manifold learning; neurologic disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pattern recognition; priority journal; autism; brain; connectome; diagnostic imaging; Graph structures","I.

Summary: In healthcare, the term big data typically refers to large quantities of electronic health record, administrative claims, and clinical trial data as well as data collected from smartphone applications, wearable devices, social media, and personal genomics services; predictive analytics refers to innovative methods of analysis developed to overcome challenges associated with big data, including a variety of statistical techniques ranging from predictive modeling to machine learning to data mining. Predictive analytics using big data have been applied successfully in several areas of medication management, such as in the identification of complex patients or those at highest risk for medication noncompliance or adverse effects. Because predictive analytics can be used in predicting different outcomes, they can provide pharmacists with a better understanding of the risks for specific medication-related problems that each patient faces. This information will enable pharmacists to deliver interventions tailored to patients' needs. In order to take full advantage of these benefits, however, clinicians will have to understand the basics of big data and predictive analytics. Conclusion: Predictive analytics that leverage big data will become an indispensable tool for clinicians in mapping interventions and improving patient outcomes. © Copyright 2017, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

The purpose of the model is to automate the cost-effective, non-invasive, digital pre-screening of patients at risk for dementia. Towards this purpose, routine care data, which is widely available through Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems is used as a data source. These data embody a rich knowledge and make related medical applications easy to deploy at scale in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the model is trained by using structured and unstructured data from three EMR data sets: diagnosis, prescriptions, and medical notes. Each of these three data sets is used to construct an individual model along with a combined model which is derived by using all three data sets. Human-interpretable data processing and ML techniques are selected in order to facilitate adoption of the proposed model by health care providers from multiple institutions. The results show that the combined model is generalizable across multiple institutions and is able to predict dementia within one year of its onset with an accuracy of nearly 80% despite the fact that it was trained using routine care data. Moreover, the analysis of the models identified important predictors for dementia. Some of these predictors (e.g., age and hypertensive disorders) are already confirmed by the literature while others, especially the ones derived from the unstructured medical notes, require further clinical analysis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dementia; EMR; Machine learning; Prediction; Random forest","Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dementia; Drug Prescriptions; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Hypertension; Machine Learning; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Neuropsychological Tests; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Cost effectiveness; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Health care; Learning systems; Machine learning; Medical applications; Medical computing; Neurodegenerative diseases; Clinical analysis; Dementia; Electronic medical record; Health care providers; Individual modeling; Patient population; Random forests; Unstructured data; Article; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; data processing; dementia; diagnostic accuracy; electronic medical record; female; human; machine learning; male; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; age; aged; complication; cost benefit analysis; dementia; economics; electronic health record; hypertension; mass screening; middle aged; neuropsychological test; predictive value; prescription; reproducibility; risk factor; theoretical model; very elderly; Data handling","Z.

The prenatal screening for DS is a key component of antenatal care and is recommended to be universally offered to women irrespective of age or background. The objective of this paper is to introduce a noninvasive and accurate diagnosis procedure for DS and to minimize social and financial cost of prenatal diagnosis. Recently, machine learning has received considerable attention in predictive analytics for medical problems. However, there is few its applications on DS prediction reported due to the difficulty of dealing with highly imbalanced and feature-correlated screening data. In this paper, we propose a cascaded machine learning framework designed for DS prediction based on three complementary stages: 1) pre-judgment with isolation forest technique, 2) model ensemble by voting strategy, and 3) final judgment using logistic regression approach. The experimental results show that the performance of this framework on maternal serum screening data set, when evaluated with different evaluation parameters, is superior to those of some machine learning methods. The best suggested combination of input features for DS screening is the group of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, unconjugated estriol, and maternal age. In addition, our method has the potential to generate further accurate prediction for imbalanced and feature-correlated data, thereby providing a novel and effective approach for certain diseases analysis. © 2013 IEEE.","Bioinformatics; cascaded framework; down syndrome prediction; ensemble learning; imbalanced learning; noninvasive prenatal diagnosis","Bioinformatics; Forecasting; Machine learning; Medical problems; Predictive analytics; cascaded framework; Down syndrome; Ensemble learning; Imbalanced Learning; Prenatal diagnosis; Diagnosis","L.

It is not only applicable to biomedical problems but it can be widely used in almost every domain since there is a relevant data structure available. Recent studies have shown that it is a powerful approach for risk stratification. Since it is a well established statistical technique, there have been several studies that combine survival analysis with machine learning algorithms in order to obtain better performances. Additionally in the machine learning scientific field the usage of different data modalities has been proven to enhance the performance of predictive models. The majority of the scientific outcomes in the survival analysis domain have focused on modeling survival data and building robust predictive models for time to event estimation. Clustering based on risk-profiles is partly under-explored in machine learning, but is critical in applications domains such as clinical decision making. Clustering in terms of survivability is very useful when there is a need to identify unknown sub-populations in the overall data. Such techniques aim for identification of clusters whose lifetime distributions significantly differs, which is something that is not able to be done by applying traditional clustering techniques. In this survey we present research studies in the aforementioned domain with an emphasis on techniques for clustering censored data and identifying various risk level groups.

Recently, similar breakthroughs are happening in the post-processing, analysis and interpretation of radiological images. Technologies such as radiomics allow to extract significantly more information from scans than what human visual assessment is capable of. This allows the precision phenotyping of diseases based on medical images. The increased amount of information can then be analyzed using novel data analytic techniques such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), which utilize the power of big data to build predictive models, which seek to mimic human intelligence, artificially. Thanks to big data availability and increased computational power, these novel analytic methods are outperforming conventional statistical techniques. In this current overview we describe the basics of radiomics, ML and DL, highlighting similarities, differences, limitations and potential pitfalls of these techniques.

This data will help provide information to develop improved pharmacovigilance for a growing cohort of older adult users. The data will be utilized by an interdisciplinary team developing new methods of identifying factors for individualized pharmacovigilance in older adults. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review to gather descriptive and quantitative data on tamoxifen pharmacovigilance. SETTING: Multi-specialty clinic. PATIENTS: Ninety-three patients 60 years of age and older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative report of tamoxifen monitoring as well as descriptive analysis of individual cases. RESULTS: We found 19 cases of serious adverse events possibly related to tamoxifen (thrombi, uterine malignancies). There were 15 cases with no documentation of pharmacovigilance. All cases had incomplete pharmacovigilance documented. There were two cases of hypercalcemia. There was one case of tamoxifen discontinuation resulting from muscle pain and with chronic muscle pain complaints while receiving tamoxifen. We observed a correlation in older age or high comorbidity burden patients and adverse events patients. CONCLUSION: Some studies direct the important pharmacovigilance toward prevention of thrombi, uterine malignancies, and hypercalcemia; however, it is not easy to identify recommendations for frequency or focus of monitoring to prevent adverse events for individual older adults based on existing recommendations. The data collected and presented in this study serve to heighten awareness of tamoxifen pharmacovigilance and as a starting point for the application of machine learning techniques and modeling to identify high-risk patients and individualized pharmacovigilance recommendations. © 2017 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc.

Cambridge Analytica is, or was – the revelations brought about its demise - a firm that used machine learning processes to try to influence elections in the US and elsewhere by, for instance, targeting ‘vulnerable’ voters in marginal seats with political advertising. Of course, there is nothing new about political candidates and parties employing firms to engage in political advertising on their behalf, but if a data firm has access to the personal information of millions of voters, and is skilled in the use of machine learning techniques, then it can develop detailed, fine-grained voter profiles that enable political actors to reach a whole new level of manipulative influence over voters. My focus in this paper is not with the highly publicised ethical and legal issues arising from Cambridge Analytic’s activities but rather with some important ethical issues arising from the use of machine learning techniques that have not received the attention and analysis that they deserve. I focus on three areas in which machine learning techniques are used or, it is claimed, should be used, and which give rise to problems at the interface of law and ethics (or law and morality, I use the terms “ethics” and “morality” interchangeably). The three areas are profiling and predictive policing (Saunders et al. 2016), legal adjudication (Zeleznikow, 2017), and machines’ compliance with legally enshrined moral principles (Arkin 2010). I note that here, as elsewhere, new and emerging technologies are developing rapidly making it difficult to predict what might or might not be able to be achieved in the future. For this reason, I have adopted the conservative stance of restricting my ethical analysis to existing machine learning techniques and applications rather than those that are the object of speculation or even informed extrapolation (Mittelstadt et al. 2015). This has the consequence that what I might regard as a limitation of machine learning techniques, e.g. in respect of predicting novel outcomes or of accommodating moral principles, might be thought by others to be merely a limitation of currently available techniques. After all, has not the history of AI recently shown the naysayers to have been proved wrong? Certainly, AI has seen some impressive results, including the construction of computers that can defeat human experts in complex games, such as chess and Go (Silver et al. 2017), and others that can do a better job than human medical experts at identifying the malignancy of moles and the like (Esteva et al. 2017). However, since by definition future machine learning techniques and applications are not yet with us the general claim that current limitations will be overcome cannot at this time be confirmed or disconfirmed on the basis of empirical evidence. © 2019 Miller.

This has been driven by the development of deep neural networks (DNNs)-complex networks residing in silico but loosely modelled on the human brain-that can process complex input data such as a chest radiograph image and output a classification such as normal' or abnormal'. DNNs are trained' using large banks of images or other input data that have been assigned the correct labels. DNNs have shown the potential to equal or even surpass the accuracy of human experts in pattern recognition tasks such as interpreting medical images or biosignals. Within respiratory medicine, the main applications of AI and machine learning thus far have been the interpretation of thoracic imaging, lung pathology slides and physiological data such as pulmonary function tests.

Early prediction of cardiac arrest can provide the time required for intervening and preventing its onset in order to reduce mortality. Traditional statistical methods have been used to predict cardiac arrest. They have often analyzed group-level differences using a limited number of variables. On the other hand, machine learning approach, which is part of a growing trend of predictive medical analysis, has provided personalized predictive analyses on more complex data and produced remarkable results. Objective: This paper has two aims. First, it offers a systematic review to evaluate the capability and performance of machine learning techniques in predicting the risk of cardiac arrest. Second, it offers an integrative framework to synthesize the researches in this field. Method: A systematic review of cardiac arrest prediction studies was carried out through Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and SpringerLink databases. These studies used machine learning techniques and were conducted between the years 2000 and 2018. Results: From a total of 1617 papers retrieved from the literature search, 75 studies were included in the final analysis. In order to explore how machine learning techniques were employed to predict cardiac arrest, a multi-layered framework was proposed. Each layer of the framework represents a classification of the current literature and contains taxonomies of relevant observed information. The framework integrates these classifications and illustrates the relative influence of a layer on other layers. The included papers were analyzed and synthesized through this framework. The used machine learning techniques were evaluated in terms of application and efficiency. The results illustrated the prediction capability of machine learning methods in predicting cardiac arrest. Conclusion: According to the results, machine learning techniques can improve the outcome of cardiac arrest prediction. However, future research should be carried out to evaluate the efficiency of rarely-used algorithms and to address the challenges of external validation, implementation and adoption of machine learning models in real clinical environments. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Framework; Heart arrest; Machine learning; Prediction; Systematic review","Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Decision Making; Heart Arrest; Humans; Medical Informatics; Proportional Hazards Models; Reproducibility of Results; Research; Support Vector Machine; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Clinical research; Efficiency; Forecasting; Heart; Learning algorithms; Framework; Heart arrest; Integrative framework; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Systematic Review; artificial neural network; clinical practice; decision tree; ensemble classifier; external validity; heart arrest; human; information processing; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; performance; practice guideline; prediction; priority journal; Review; support vector machine; systematic review; algorithm; decision making; factual database; heart arrest; medical informatics; procedures; proportional hazards model; reproducibility; research; support vector machine; Learning systems","M.M.

A clinical data set of 126 patients (56 healthy controls, 70 with CLD) was analyzed. First, an RGB-to-stiffness inverse mapping technique was employed. A five-cluster segmentation was then performed associating corresponding different-color regions with certain stiffness value ranges acquired from the SWE manufacturer-provided color bar. Subsequently, 35 features (7 for each cluster), indicative of physical characteristics existing within the SWE image, were extracted. A stepwise regression analysis toward feature reduction was used to derive a reduced feature subset that was fed into the support vector machine classification algorithm to classify CLD from healthy cases. The highest accuracy in classification of healthy to CLD subject discrimination from the support vector machine model was 87.3% with sensitivity and specificity values of 93.5% and 81.2%, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis gave an area under the curve value of 0.87 (confidence interval: 0.77–0.92). A machine-learning algorithm that quantifies color information in terms of stiffness values from SWE images and discriminates CLD from healthy cases is introduced. New objective parameters and criteria for CLD diagnosis employing SWE images provided by the present study can be considered an important step toward color-based interpretation, and could assist radiologists’ diagnostic performance on a daily basis after being installed in a PC and employed retrospectively, immediately after the examination. © 2017 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology","Classifier design; Computer-aided diagnosis; Fibrosis; Shear wave elastography; Ultrasonics","Adolescent; Aged; Algorithms; Chronic Disease; Color; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Female; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult; Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Color; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Regression analysis; Shear flow; Shear waves; Shearing machines; Stiffness; Support vector machines; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonics; Classifier design; Computer aided diagnosis systems; Fibrosis; Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis; Shear wave elastography; Stepwise regression analysis; Support vector machine classification; Support vector machine models; adult; aged; Article; chronic liver disease; classification algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; female; human; liver stiffness; machine learning; major clinical study; male; predictive value; priority journal; radial based function; real time ultrasound scanner; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; shear wave elastography; support vector machine; adolescent; algorithm; chronic disease; color; diagnostic imaging; elastography; liver; liver disease; middle aged; procedures; young adult; Learning algorithms","G.C.

COPD failure imposes a significant social and economic burden on society, and predicting such failure is crucial to early intervention and decision-making, making this a very important research issue. Current analysis methods address all risk factors in medical records indiscriminately and therefore generally suffer from ineffectiveness in real applications, mainly because many of these factors relate weakly to prediction. Numerous studies have been done on selecting factors for survival analysis, but their inherent shortcomings render these methods inapplicable for failure prediction in the context of unknown and intricate correlation patterns among risk factors. These difficulties have prompted us to design a new Cox-based learning machine that embeds the feature weighting technique into failure prediction. In order to improve predictive accuracy, we propose two weighting criteria to maximize the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the concordance index (C-index), respectively. At the same time, we perform a Dirichlet-based regularization on weights, making differences between factor relevance clearly visible while maintaining the model's high predictive ability. The experimental results on real-life COPD data collected from patients hospitalized at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning machine and its great promise in clinical applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","COPD; Failure prediction; Learning machine; Risk factor; Weighting","Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Canada; Electronic Health Records; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Readmission; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Survival Analysis; Time Factors; Decision making; Factor analysis; Failure (mechanical); Forecasting; Pulmonary diseases; Risk assessment; antibiotic agent; benzodiazepine; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; bronchodilating agent; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; oseltamivir; oxygen; statin (protein); vaccine; biological marker; COPD; Failure prediction; Learning machines; Risk factors; Weighting; accuracy; age; aged; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; dyspnea; female; human; length of stay; lymphocyte count; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical record; neutrophil count; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; survival rate; Canada; chronic obstructive lung disease; electronic health record; hospital readmission; hospitalization; middle aged; mortality; pathophysiology; predictive value; prognosis; proportional hazards model; receiver operating characteristic; severity of illness index; sex factor; survival analysis; time factor; very elderly; Learning systems","S.

This finds wide application in areas of activity monitoring, bio-medical rehabilitation, and fitness tracking. Primary challenges in embedded application development for smart wearable include high energy efficiency and user compatibility. Existing algorithms and applications are still unable to fully utilize the true power of the data being collected. They provide lot of descriptive data analytics but lack in predictive analysis. Energy efficiency of computing as predicted by Koomey’s is expected to strike the second law of thermodynamics based on Launder’s Limit within few decades. In this work an energy efficient computing technique for next generation mobile applications is developed. Proposed Artificial Intelligence based energy-efficient embedded algorithm that provide personalized training sequence recommendation in order to achieve desired calorie goals. Suggested training sequence of 6 activities fall under high, medium and low calorie burn with achieved median for 234C:535C:688C respectively. The crux of this implementation is Calorie Matrix Regeneration via state feedback technique using Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Number of generations required by the GA to reach a suboptimal solution is optimized. While Machine learning algorithms are written in C/C++ for effective embedded implementation, certain computationally expensive modules like MDP and GA are coded in Python with proposed IoT cloud based implementation thereby improving battery efficiency to 12–16 h. This implementation is first of its kind and a step ahead of available state of the art fitness training algorithms/applications. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Activities of daily living (ADL); Genetic algorithm (GA); Human activity recognition (HAR); Internet of things (IOT); Markov decision process (MDP); Smart activity trainer; Smart wearables","Artificial intelligence; C++ (programming language); Genetic algorithms; Green computing; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Nanoelectronics; Predictive analytics; State feedback; Thermodynamics; Wearable technology; Activities of Daily Living; Human activity recognition; Internet of Things (IOT); Markov Decision Processes; Smart activity trainer; Smart wearables; Energy efficiency","H.S.

However outside of the human body many of these communities remain poorly studied. The Metagenomics and Metadesign of the Subways and Urban Biomes (MetaSUB) International Consortium is characterizing the microbiomes of urban environments with the aim to improve design of mass transit systems. As part of the CAMDA 2018 MetaSUB Forensics Challenge 311 city microbiome samples were provided to create urban microbial fingerprints, as well as a further 3 mystery datasets for validation. Results: MetaSUB samples were clustered using t-SNE in an unsupervised fashion to almost discrete groups, which upon inspection represented city of origin. Based on this clustering, geographically close metropolitan areas appear to display similar microbial profiles such as those of Auckland and Hamilton. Mystery unlabeled samples were provided part of the challenge. A random forest classifier built on the initial dataset of 311 samples was capable of correctly classifying 83.3% of the mystery samples to their city of origin. Random Forest analyses also identified features with the highest discriminatory power, ranking bacterial species such as Campylobacter jejuni and Staphylococcus argenteus as highly predictive of city of origin. The surface from which the sample was collected displayed little detectable impact on the microbial profiles in the data generated here. The proportion of reads classified per sample varied greatly and so de-novo assembly was applied to recover genomic fragments representing organisms not captured in reference databases. Conclusions: Current methods can differentiate urban microbiome profiles from each other with relative ease. De-novo assembly indicated that the MetaSUB metagenomic data contains adequate depth to recover metagenomic assembled genomes and that current databases are not sufficient to fully characterize urban microbiomes. Profiles found here indicate there may be a relationship between geographical distance between areas and the urban microbiome composition although this will need further research. The impact of these different profiles on public health is currently unknown but the MetaSUB consortium is uniquely suited to evaluate these and provide a roadmap for the inclusion of urban microbiome information for city planning and public health policy.

Consequently, this has opened enormous opportunities for the machine learning and data science field, translating into the development of new algorithms in a wide range of applications in medical, biomedical, daily-life, and national security areas. Ensemble techniques are among the pillars of the machine learning field, and they can be defined as approaches in which multiple, complex, independent/uncorrelated, predictive models are subsequently combined by either averaging or voting to yield a higher model performance. Random forest (RF), a popular ensemble method, has been successfully applied in various domains due to its ability to build predictive models with high certainty and little necessity of model optimization. RF provides both a predictive model and an estimation of the variable importance. However, the estimation of the variable importance is based on thousands of trees, and therefore, it does not specify which variable is important for which sample group. The present study demonstrates an approach based on the pseudo-sample principle that allows for construction of bi-plots (i.e. spin plots) associated with RF models. The pseudo-sample principle for RF. is explained and demonstrated by using two simulated datasets, and three different types of real data, which include political sciences, food chemistry and the human microbiome data. The pseudo-sample bi-plots, associated with RF and its unsupervised version, allow for a versatile visualization of multivariate models, and the variable importance and the relation among them. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bi-plots; Principal coordinates analysis; Proximity matrix; Pseudo samples; Random forest interpretation","Bioinformatics; Decision trees; Machine learning; National security; Random forests; Ensemble techniques; Model optimization; Model performance; Multivariate models; Predictive modeling; Simulated datasets; Technological development; Variable importances; human; microbiome; nonhuman; random forest; review; simulation; Predictive analytics","A.

Selective testing of those at higher risk of failure may improve efficiency. We investigated whether a novel analysis of adherence data could correctly classify virological failure and potentially inform a selective testing strategy. Design: Multisite prospective cohort consortium. Methods: We evaluated longitudinal data on 1478 adult patients treated with ART and monitored using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) in 16 US cohorts contributing to the MACH14 consortium. Because the relationship between adherence and virological failure is complex and heterogeneous, we applied a machine-learning algorithm (Super Learner) to build a model for classifying failure and evaluated its performance using cross-validation. Results: Application of the Super Learner algorithm to MEMS data, combined with data on CD4+ T-cell counts and ART regimen, significantly improved classification of virological failure over a single MEMS adherence measure. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, evaluated on data not used in model fitting, was 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 0.80) and 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.76 to 0.81) for failure defined as single HIV RNA level >1000 copies per milliliter or >400 copies per milliliter, respectively. Our results suggest that 25%-31% of viral load tests could be avoided while maintaining sensitivity for failure detection at or above 95%, for a cost savings of $16-$29 per person-month. Conclusions: Our findings provide initial proof of concept for the potential use of electronic medication adherence data to reduce costs through behavior-driven HIV RNA testing.

METHODS: We used Class Prediction Analysis to predict binary outcomes (life/death, good/bad Extended Glasgow Outcome Score, etc.) based on data accrued within 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after admission to the neuro-trauma intensive care unit. Univariate analyses selected ""features,"" discriminator VS segments or ""genes,"" in each individual's data set. Prediction models using these selected features were then constructed using six different statistical modeling techniques to predict outcome for other individuals in the sample cohort based on the selected features of each individual then cross-validated with a leave-one-out method. RESULTS: We gleaned complete sets of 588 VS monitoring segment features for each of four periods and outcomes from 52 of 60 patients with severe traumatic brain injury who met study inclusion criteria. Overall, intracranial pressures and blood pressures over time (e.g., intracranial pressure >20 mm Hg for 20 minutes) provided the best discrimination for outcomes. Modeling performed best in the first 12 hours of care and for mortality. The mean number of selected features included 76 predicting 14-day hospital stay in that period, 11 predicting mortality, and 4 predicting 3-month Extended Glasgow Outcome Score. Four of the six techniques constructed models that correctly identified mortality by 12 hours 75% of the time or higher. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that valid prediction models after severe traumatic brain injury can be constructed using gene mapping techniques to analyze large data sets from conventional electronic monitoring data, but that this methodology needs validation in larger data sets, and that additional unstructured learning techniques may also prove useful.

They play a crucial role in harnessing the power of Big Data being produced every day in our digital world. In general, building a well-performing machine learning pipeline is an iterative and complex process that requires a solid understanding of various techniques that can be used in each component of the machine learning pipeline. Feature engineering (FE) is one of the most time-consuming steps in building machine learning pipelines. It requires a deep understanding of the domain and data exploration to discover relevant hand-crafted features from raw data. In this work, we empirically evaluate the impact of integrating an automated feature extraction tool (AutoFeat) into two automated machine learning frameworks, namely, Auto-Sklearn and TPOT, on their predictive performance. Besides, we discuss the limitations of AutoFeat that need to be addressed in order to improve the predictive performance of the automated machine learning frameworks on real-world datasets. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automated feature engineering; Automated machine learning","Automation; Diagnosis; Extraction; Feature extraction; Iterative methods; Pipelines; Automated feature extraction; Empirical analysis; Feature engineerings; Financial applications; Machine learning techniques; Medical diagnosis system; Predictive performance; Real-world datasets; Machine learning","H.

Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) are proving as valuable resources for knowledge extraction & predictive modelling which enables support for cost-saving and timely decision making in offering a treatment to a patient. One can analyse & process these healthcare records to transform the way care is delivered and compensated. Integrating and transforming these heterogeneous data into single format needs efficient Machine Learning techniques. Precise analysis of medical records benefits patient care, early disease detection and community services. But, when the quality of medical data is incomplete, the analysis of accuracy gets reduced. With regards, machine learning (ML) based artificial intelligence plays a significant role which is used for large and complex issues and also consumes less computation time due to stochastic feature of the search methods. However, we are facing issues like less communication efficiency that includes lack of cognitive bias, training, recognition, and cultural hierarchy in a medical application. Also, there is a lack of tool development which has been neglected in most of the research and still relies on manual assessment. Hence there is a need of an effective model that will enhance the diagnosis performance for timely medical care which is followed by appropriate succeeding treatment, thus resultant in significant lifesaving. This paper focuses on the development of effective supervised learning-based ML framework which would serve as a valuable aid to detect/categorize disease and make a real-time effective clinical decision. © 2020 SERSC.","Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs); Healthcare; Holistic Health Records (HHRs); Machine Learning (ML); Predictive Modelling; Semantic Enrichment","","","","Science and Engineering Research Support Society","20054238","","","","English","Int.

NIR spectra are usually of very high dimensions and contain huge amounts of information. Most of the information is irrelevant to the target problem and some is simply noise. Thus, it is not an easy task to discover the relationship between NIR spectra and the predictive variable. However, this kind of regression analysis is one of the main topics of machine learning. Thus machine learning techniques play a key role in NIR based analytical approaches. Pre-processing of NIR spectral data has become an integral part of chemometrics modeling. The objective of the pre-processing is to remove physical phenomena (noise) in the spectra in order to improve the regression or classification model. In this work, we propose to reduce the noise using extreme learning machines which have shown good predictive performances in regression applications as well as in large dataset classification tasks. For this, we use a novel algorithm called C-PL-ELM, which has an architecture in parallel based on a non-linear layer in parallel with another non-linear layer. Using the soft margin loss function concept, we incorporate two Lagrange multipliers with the objective of including the noise of spectral data. Six real-life dataset were analyzed to illustrate the performance of the developed models. The results for regression and classification problems confirm the advantages of using the proposed method in terms of root mean square error and accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Constrained optimization; Near-infrared spectroscopy; Parallel layers; Regression","Classification (of information); Constrained optimization; Knowledge acquisition; Lagrange multipliers; Learning systems; Mean square error; Near infrared spectroscopy; Noise abatement; Regression analysis; Extreme learning machine; Machine learning techniques; Near infrared spectra; Parallel layers; Predictive performance; Regression; Regression applications; Root mean square errors; Infrared devices","G.A.

The expected time to failure is not considered explicitly. On the other hand, there is a survival analysis that deals with the time of the occurrence of the event of interest (while this event may not occur during observation). However, despite its popularity in the medical and technical sciences, survival analysis is relatively rarely used in predicting financial failure. Even when it is applied, most authors use the simplest form of a model. The goal of our work is to evaluate the applicability of survival analysis to bankruptcy prediction. We compare a few state-of-art statistical and machine learning models using a real dataset.

These robotic applications are required an ability to aware their operating conditions due to safety reasons as they are likely to be operated close to humans. One of the major parameters to examine the situations is rotor torque which conventionally acquired by a torque transducer. However, using such device requires extra cost, bulky mechanical installation, and data acquisition electronics. Due to this trade-off, we propose a machine learning based method for rotor torque estimation. The information used in the estimation process are solely electrical signals generated by the motor itself without any actual sensor required. In this paper we present an investigation and feasibility study of the proposed sensorless torque estimation. A motor test bench has been developed for observing motor characteristics also for collecting information to create torque prediction models. Numerous statistical based machine learning methods have been applied in this work including Neural Networks regression, Linear regression, and Stepwise regression. The proposed system has been used to created prediction models according to the occupied regression methods. The estimation performance has been considered by comparing the estimated results with ground truths from an actual torque sensor. The estimation model based on Neural network regression has achieved highest accuracy at 0.11 of RMSE and 0.996 of R value.

Recently, wearable devices have become popular with wide applications in the health monitoring system which has stimulated the growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The IoMT has an important role to play in reducing the mortality rate by the early detection of disease. The prediction of heart disease is a key issue in the analysis of clinical dataset. The aim of the proposed investigation is to identify the key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Many studies have focused on heart disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of the findings is low. Therefore, to improve prediction accuracy, an IoMT framework for the diagnosis of heart disease using modified salp swarm optimization (MSSO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS improves the search capability using the Levy flight algorithm. The regular learning process in ANFIS is dependent on gradient-based learning and has a tendency to become trapped in local minima. The learning parameters are optimized utilizing MSSO to provide better results for ANFIS. The following information is taken from medical records to predict the risk of heart disease: blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. The heart condition is identified by classifying the received sensor data using MSSO-ANFIS. A simulation and analysis is conducted to show that MSSA-ANFIS works well in relation to disease prediction. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the MSSO-ANFIS prediction model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS prediction model obtains an accuracy of 99.45 with a precision of 96.54, which is higher than the other approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","ANFIS; heart disease; Internet of Medical Things; Internet of Things; LCSA; MSSO","Agricultural robots; Blood; Blood pressure; Cardiology; Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Health care; Heart; Learning systems; Monitoring; Predictive analytics; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Gradient-based learning; Health monitoring system; Heart disease diagnosis; Machine learning techniques; Prediction of heart disease; Simulation and analysis; Simulation demonstrate; Diseases","F.

The radiomics approach aims to extract and analyze quantitative multiple informative data from medical images unseen by the expert eyes, thus the need for enhancing the ability of the machine learning algorithm to classify different lesions. Generally the radiomics techniques have led to high dimensionality, which may cause overfitting, increasing the complexity of the predictive model and degrading the prediction performance. Thereby, feature selection aims at solving this problem by selecting the relevant features and removing the irrelevant and redundant ones. In this study we present the exploitation of heterogeneous radiomics features for supporting decision-based clinical tasks and the ability of various machine learning classifiers, combined with several feature selection methods, to accurately predict breast cancer nodules. This study uses 593 radiomics features to quantify the intensity, shape and texture of breast tumor images to classify the binary outcome of the benign or malignant status. The uncertainty feature selection, in addition to the decision tree have scores the best performance among 66 other feature selection/classifier combinations (accuracy = 0.85). On the other hand, the t-Test and the Gaussian naïve Bayes have the worst performing combination (accuracy = 0.49).

We review both physiological models and machine learning results across a diverse range of applications in energy homeostasis, and highlight how modelling and machine learning can work together to improve predictive ability. We collect quantitative details in a comprehensive mathematical supplement.

Predictive analytics can also reduce the machines downtimes and decrease the production of faulty products. This paper introduces predictive analytics for industrial ovens and their application in a real-world’s oven used by a leading medical devices manufacturer. Two distinct approaches are presented in this work. A technique based on existing sensors for oven failure prediction based on monitoring and log data; and a technique based on deployed sensors for fault diagnosis based on acoustic data. Deep learning techniques have been applied on existing sensor and event log data, especially temperature monitoring, whereas an outlier detection analysis were implemented on acoustic sensor measurements.

The current studies, which are mostly linear modeling-based statistical analyses, have focused on small sets of disparate predictive factors where many potentially important variables are neglected in their analyses. Data mining methods, such as machine learning-based approaches, are capable of providing an effective way of overcoming these limitations by utilizing sufficiently large data sets with many predictive factors to identify not only linear associations but also highly complex, non-linear relationships. Therefore, this study is aimed at exploring risk groups of thoracic recipients through machine learning-based methods. Methods and material: A large, feature-rich, nation-wide thoracic transplantation dataset (obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing-UNOS) is used to develop predictive models for the survival time estimation. The predictive factors that are most relevant to the survival time identified via, (1) conducting sensitivity analysis on models developed by the machine learning methods, (2) extraction of variables from the published literature, and (3) eliciting variables from the medical experts and other domain specific knowledge bases. A unified set of predictors is then used to develop a Cox regression model and the related prognosis indices. A comparison of clustering algorithm-based and conventional risk grouping techniques is conducted based on the outcome of the Cox regression model in order to identify optimal number of risk groups of thoracic recipients. Finally, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is performed to validate the discrimination among the identified various risk groups. Results: The machine learning models performed very effectively in predicting the survival time: the support vector machine model with a radial basis Kernel function produced the best fit with an R2 value of 0.879, the artificial neural network (multilayer perceptron-MLP-model) came the second with an R2 value of 0.847, and the M5 algorithm-based regression tree model came last with an R2 value of 0.785. Following the proposed method, a consolidated set of predictive variables are determined and used to build the Cox survival model. Using the prognosis indices revealed by the Cox survival model along with a k-means clustering algorithm, an optimal number of "" three"" risk groups is identified. The significance of differences among these risk groups are also validated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the integrated machine learning method to select the predictor variables is more effective in developing the Cox survival models than the traditional methods commonly found in the literature. The significant distinction among the risk groups of thoracic patients also validates the effectiveness of the methodology proposed herein. We anticipate that this study (and other AI based analytic studies like this one) will lead to more effective analyses of thoracic transplant procedures to better understand the prognosis of thoracic organ recipients. It would potentially lead to new medical and biological advances and more effective allocation policies in the field of organ transplantation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Machine learning; Prognostic index; Survival analysis; Thoracic Transplantation; UNOS","Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meiers Estimate; Lung Transplantation; Male; Medical Informatics Applications; Models, Biological; Prognosis; Bioinformatics; Biological organs; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Group technology; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Metal recovery; Mining; Neural networks; Optimization; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Transplantation (surgical); Trees (mathematics); Allocation policies; Artificial Neural Network; Best fit; Cox regression; Data mining methods; Data sets; Domain-specific knowledge; Effective analysis; Integrated machines; K-Means clustering algorithm; Kaplan-Meier; Kernel function; Large datasets; Linear modeling; Machine learning; Machine learning methods; Medical experts; Multi layer perceptron; Non-linear relationships; Optimal number; Predictive factors; Predictive models; Predictive variables; Predictor variables; Prognostic analysis; Radial basis; Regression tree models; Risk grouping; Statistical analysis; Survival analysis; Survival model; Survival time; article; artificial neural network; cluster analysis; controlled study; data extraction; graft recipient; heart lung transplantation; high risk patient; human; intermethod comparison; Kaplan Meier method; kernel method; knowledge base; machine learning; medical expert; patient identification; prediction; predictor variable; priority journal; prognosis; proportional hazards model; sensitivity analysis; support vector machine; survival time; validation process; Time domain analysis","D.

It has been shown that patients with diabetes are associated with a longer length of hospital stay (LOS) and increased associated healthcare cost. The uncertainty of diabetic patients' LOS makes it difficult for hospitals to optimize their scheduling process. In this paper, we applied the stacked ensemble method, with deep learning as the meta-learning algorithm, to predict long vs. short LOS for diabetic patients. The obtained results show that stacked ensemble technique is promising in this field because stacking multiple classification learning algorithms resulted in a better predictive performance than that obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms.

The widespread use of AI technology in diagnosing and treating several types of cancer, especially colorectal cancer (CRC), is now attracting substantial attention. CRC, which represents the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy in both men and women, is considered a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Our review herein aims to provide in-depth knowledge and analysis of the AI applications in CRC screening, diagnosis, and treatment based on current literature. We also explore the role of recent advances in AI systems regarding medical diagnosis and therapy, with several promising results. CRC is a highly preventable disease, and AI-assisted techniques in routine screening represent a pivotal step in declining incidence rates of this malignancy. So far, computer-aided detection and characterization systems have been developed to increase the detection rate of adenomas. Furthermore, CRC treatment enters a new era with robotic surgery and novel computer-assisted drug delivery techniques. At the same time, healthcare is rapidly moving toward precision or personalized medicine. Machine learning models have the potential to contribute to individual-based cancer care and transform the future of medicine. © 2021 by the authors.

Having shown performance equaling that of experienced radiologists in tasks such as detecting pneumonia on chest X-rays and identifying cancerous long nodules on X-ray, AI is poised to radically optimize many areas of medical practice from early detection of disease to prediction of progression and personalization of therapeutic strategy. Artificial intelligence extends classical statistical techniques and machine learning, both of which characteristically involve manually establishing imaging features hypothesized to modulate a certain outcome. With AI, predictive features are automatically established in a data-driven fashion, which in turn implies that raw unprocessed data can be fully utilized, human bias can be avoided, and previously unrealized disease mechanisms potentially can be discovered. Here we discuss applications of AI in PET imaging for image reconstruction, attenuation correction without CT, dose reduction, automatic identification of pathology, and differentiation of disease progression. One of the costs of more automated analyses and better accuracy with AI compared to classical machine learning is larger volumes of training data; however, the field is rapidly evolving, and we discuss possible mitigations as well as other directions for valuable future applications of AI in PET imaging. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Artificial intelligence; Attenuation correction; Automated detection of pathology; Central nervous system; Deep learning; Dose reduction; Image reconstruction; Neurodegenerative disease; Positron emission tomography (PET)","","K.

Extensive health utilisation data collection through electronic health records (EHR) and claims data represent new opportunities for scientific discovery. Big data science (BDS) is a powerful tool for investigating HIV care utilisation patterns. The South Carolina (SC) office of Revenue and Fiscal Affairs (RFA) data warehouse captures individual-level longitudinal health utilisation data for persons living with HIV (PLWH). The data warehouse includes EHR, claims and data from private institutions, housing, prisons, mental health, Medicare, Medicaid, State Health Plan and the department of health and human services. The purpose of this study is to describe the process for creating a comprehensive database of all SC PLWH, and plans for using BDS to explore, identify, characterise and explain new predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilisation. Methods and analysis This project will create person-level profiles guided by the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model and describe new patterns of HIV care utilisation. The population for the comprehensive database comes from statewide HIV surveillance data (2005-2016) for all SC PLWH (N≈18000). Surveillance data are available from the state health department's enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (e-HARS). Additional data pulls for the e-HARS population will include Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Service Reports, Health Sciences SC data and Area Health Resource Files. These data will be linked to the RFA data and serve as sources for traditional and vulnerable domain Gelberg-Anderson Behavioral Model variables. The project will use BDS techniques such as machine learning to identify new predictors of HIV care utilisation behaviour among PLWH, and â € missed opportunities' for re-engaging them back into care. Ethics and dissemination The study team applied for data from different sources and submitted individual Institutional Review Board (IRB) applications to the University of South Carolina (USC) IRB and other local authorities/agencies/state departments. This study was approved by the USC IRB (#Pro00068124) in 2017. To protect the identity of the persons living with HIV (PLWH), researchers will only receive linked deidentified data from the RFA. Study findings will be disseminated at local community forums, community advisory group meetings, meetings with our state agencies, local partners and other key stakeholders (including PLWH, policy-makers and healthcare providers), presentations at academic conferences and through publication in peer-reviewed articles. Data security and patient confidentiality are the bedrock of this study. Extensive data agreements ensuring data security and patient confidentiality for the deidentified linked data have been established and are stringently adhered to. The RFA is authorised to collect and merge data from these different sources and to ensure the privacy of all PLWH. The legislatively mandated SC data oversight council reviewed the proposed process stringently before approving it. Researchers will get only the encrypted deidentified dataset to prevent any breach of privacy in the data transfer, management and analysis processes. In addition, established secure data governance rules, data encryption and encrypted predictive techniques will be deployed. In addition to the data anonymisation as a part of privacy-preserving analytics, encryption schemes that protect running prediction algorithms on encrypted data will also be deployed. Best practices and lessons learnt about the complex processes involved in negotiating and navigating multiple data sharing agreements between different entities are being documented for dissemination. © 2019 Author(s).","big data science; health care utilisation; HIV/AIDS; machine learning; predictive modeling","Big Data; Confidentiality; Data Science; Electronic Health Records; HIV Infections; Humans; Insurance Coverage; Logistic Models; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Population Surveillance; Research Design; South Carolina; adult; anonymised data; article; big data; computer security; confidentiality; controlled study; data warehouse; electronic health record; ethics; health care personnel; health care utilization; health science; housing; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; identity; institutional review; interpersonal communication; machine learning; medicaid; medical care; medicare; mental health; nonhuman; prediction; prison; privacy; psychological model; public health service; publication; running; scientist; South Carolina; health survey; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; insurance; methodology; patient attitude; procedures; South Carolina; statistical model","B.

Such patients are well suited to having their physiological condition monitored using low-power, minimally intrusive wearable sensors. Despite data-collection systems now being manufactured commercially, allowing physiological data to be acquired from mobile patients, little work has been undertaken on the use of the resultant data in a principled manner for robust patient care, including predictive monitoring. Most current devices generate so many false-positive alerts that devices cannot be used for routine clinical practice. This paper explores principled machine learning approaches to interpreting large quantities of continuously acquired, multivariate physiological data, using wearable patient monitors, where the goal is to provide early warning of serious physiological determination, such that a degree of predictive care may be provided. We adopt a one-class support vector machine formulation, proposing a formulation for determining the free parameters of the model using partial area under the ROC curve, a method arising from the unique requirements of performing online analysis with data from patient-worn sensors. There are few clinical evaluations of machine learning techniques in the literature, so we present results from a study at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust devised to investigate the large-scale clinical use of patient-worn sensors for predictive monitoring in a ward with a high incidence of patient mortality. We show that our system can combine routine manual observations made by clinical staff with the continuous data acquired from wearable sensors. Practical considerations and recommendations based on our experiences of this clinical study are discussed, in the context of a framework for personalized monitoring. © 2013 IEEE.","E-health; novelty detection; personalized monitoring; Predictive monitoring","Clothing; Humans; Individualized Medicine; Medical Informatics Applications; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Support Vector Machines; Telemedicine; Hospitals; Learning systems; Patient monitoring; Physiology; Support vector machines; Clinical observation; Data collection system; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Novelty detection; One-class support vector machine; Physiological condition; Predictive monitoring; ambulatory monitoring; clothing; devices; human; medical informatics; personalized medicine; procedures; signal processing; support vector machine; telemedicine; Wearable sensors","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21682194","","ITIBF","24808218","English","IEEE J.

PLGA-based multiparticulate dosage forms are usually prepared as microspheres where the size is from 5 to 100 µm, depending on the route of administration. The main objectives of the study were to develop a predictive model of mean volumetric particle size and on its basis extract knowledge of PLGA containing proteins forming behaviour. Methods In the present study, a model for the prediction of mean volumetric particle size developed by an rgp package of R environment is presented. Other tools like fscaret, monmlp, fugeR, MARS, SVM, kNNreg, Cubist, randomForest and piecewise linear regression are also applied during the data mining procedure. Results The feature selection provided by the fscaret package reduced the original input vector from a total of 295 input variables to 10, 16 and 19. The developed models had good predictive ability, which was confirmed by a normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of 6.8 to 11.1% in 10-fold cross validation training procedure. Moreover, the best models were validated using external experimental data. The superior predictiveness had a model obtained by rgp in the form of a classical equation with a normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) of 6.1%. Conclusions A new approach is proposed for computational modelling of the mean particle size of PLGA microspheres and rules extraction from tree-based models. The feature selection leads to revealing chemical descriptor variables which are important in predicting the size of PLGA microspheres. In order to achieve better understanding in the relationships between particle size and formulation characteristics, the surface analysis method and rules extraction procedures were applied. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Feature selection; Heuristic modelling; Molecular descriptors; Particle size; Poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) microparticles; Rules extraction","Empirical Research; Lactic Acid; Machine Learning; Microspheres; Particle Size; Polyglycolic Acid; Support Vector Machine; Data mining; Drug delivery; Extraction; Feature extraction; Functional polymers; Mean square error; Medical applications; Microspheres; Particle size; Piecewise linear techniques; Surface analysis; microsphere; polyglactin; lactic acid; polyglycolic acid; polylactic acid-polyglycolic acid copolymer; 10-fold cross-validation; Micro-particles; Molecular descriptors; Piecewise linear regression; Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid); Root mean squared errors; Rules extraction; Surface analysis methods; Article; empirical research; evolutionary algorithm; fuzzy system; machine learning; macromolecule; mathematical model; particle size; prediction; protein quaternary structure; random forest; support vector machine; surface property; chemistry; particle size; validation study; Particle size analysis","J.

Tinnitus pathophysiology is enigmatic and its significant heterogeneity reflects a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, severity and annoyance among tinnitus sufferers. Although several interventions have been suggested, currently there is no universally accepted treatment. Moreover, there is no well-established correlation between tinnitus features or patients’ characteristics and projection of treatment response. At the clinical level, this practically means that selection of treatment is not based on expected outcomes for the particular patient. The complexity of tinnitus and lack of well-adapted prognostic factors for treatment selection highlight a potential role for a decision support system (DSS). A DSS is an informative system, based on big data that aims to facilitate decision-making based on: specific rules, retrospective data reflecting results, patient profiling and predictive models. Therefore, it can use algorithms evaluating numerous parameters and indicate the weight of their contribution to the final outcome. This means that DSS can provide additional information, exceeding the typical questions of superiority of one treatment versus another, commonly addressed in literature. The development of a DSS for tinnitus treatment selection will make use of an underlying database consisting of medical, epidemiological, audiological, electrophysiological, genetic and tinnitus subtyping data. Algorithms will be developed with the use of machine learning and data mining techniques. Based on the profile features identified as prognostic these algorithms will be able to suggest whether additional examinations are needed for a robust result as well as which treatment or combination of treatments is optimal for every patient in a personalized level. In this manuscript we carefully define the conceptual basis for a tinnitus treatment selection DSS. We describe the big data set and the knowledge base on which the DSS will be based and the algorithms that will be used for prognosis and treatment selection. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data; Clinical decision support system; Personalized treatment; Tinnitus","Big Data; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Tinnitus; algorithm; annoyance; artificial intelligence; audiography; big data; clinical decision support system; cognitive behavioral therapy; data analysis; data base; data mining; data quality; decision making; decision support system; electrophysiology; female; follow up; genetic screening; hearing; hearing impairment; human; knowledge; knowledge base; lifestyle; machine learning; mobile application; personalized medicine; prognosis; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); tinnitus; treatment response; retrospective study; tinnitus","W.

With manual processing becoming more complicated, stagnant and unfeasible with higher data size, there necessitates automatic processing that can transform contemporary medicine. Deep learning mechanisms can arrive at a higher rate of accuracy in processing and classifying images in comparison with human-level performance. Deep learning not only assist in selecting and extracting features but also possesses the potentiality of measuring predictive target audience and bestows prediction in a more action format to help doctors significantly. Unsupervised Deep Learning for cancer diagnosis is advantageous whenever the involvement of unlabeled data is huge. By bestowing unsupervised deep learning techniques to such unlabeled data, features of pixels that are superior compared to manually obtained features of pixels are said to be learned. Supervised Discriminating Deep Learning directly provides discriminating potentiality for cancer diagnosis purposes. Finally, hybrid deep learning for labeled and unlabeled data is specifically used for cancer diagnosis with a resource or poor pixel representations and hence early detection and diagnosis performed via bank features. Deep Neural Network, as the name implies includes several layers, emphasizing the complex non-linear relationships between the features present in the images, therefore contributing to higher accuracy. Deep Belief Network used in both supervised and unsupervised deep learning adopting greedy mechanism, maximizing the likelihood nature of detection and diagnosis at an early stage. Sequential event analysis is said to be performed by Recurrent Neural Network with the weights being shared across all neurons, contributing diagnosis accuracy. Certain fine-tuned learning parameters of consideration for better and precise learning are Interaction and Non-linear Rectified Activation function, Circumventing over-fitting via Dropout and Optimal Epoch Batch Normalization. In the last section, challenges about the application of deep learning for cancer diagnosis are discussed. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.","Artificial intelligence; Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Machine learning; Medical image processing; Sparse auto encoders","","R.

Applications such as credit rating, medical diagnosis, mine-rock discrimination, fraud detection, and identification of objects in astronomical images generate thousands of instances for analysis with little or no additional information about the type of analysis technique most appropriate for the task at hand. Since real-world applications are generally time-sensitive, practitioners and researchers tend to use only a few available algorithms for data analysis, hoping that the set of assumptions embedded in these algorithms will match the characteristics of the data. Such practice in data mining and the application of machine learning has spurred the research community to investigate whether learning from data is made of a single operational layer - search for a good model that fits the data - or whether there are in fact several operational layers that can be exploited to produce an increase in performance over time. The latter alternative implies that it should be possible to learn about the learning process itself, and in particular that a system could learn to profit from previous experience to generate additional knowledge that can simplify the automatic selection of efficient models summarizing the data. This book provides a review and analysis of a research direction in machine learning and data mining known as metalearning.1 From a practical standpoint, the goal of metalearning is twofold. On the one hand, we wish to overcome some of the challenges faced by users with current data analysis tools. The aim here is to aid users in the task of selecting a suitable predictive model (or combination of models) while taking into account the domain of application. Without some kind of assistance, model selection and combination can turn into solid obstacles to end users who wish to access the technology more directly and cost-effectively. End users often lack not only the expertise necessary to select a suitable model, but also the availability of many models to proceed on a trial-and-error basis. A solution to this problem is attainable through the construction of metalearning systems that provide automatic and systematic user guidance by mapping a particular task to a suitable model (or combination of models). © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","","Algorithms; Data mining; Diagnosis; Image matching; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Profitability; Research; Reviews; Additional knowledge; Analysis techniques; Astronomical images; Automatic selection; Credit ratings; Current data; Data analysis; End users; Fraud detection; Learning process; Machine-learning; Medical diagnosis; Meta-learning system; Metalearning; Model Selection; Predictive models; Real-world application; Research communities; Research directions; Solid obstacles; User guidance; Data handling","","Brazdil P.; Soares C.; Universidade do Porto, Fac.

Machine Learning (ML) methods have the ability to learns from data, inferring from examples a general hypothesis that can approximate complex relationships in the data for descriptive or predictive aims. The ML is particularly useful for domains that are poorly understood due to the lack of a clear theory but where there are collections of relevant real-world data that can be affected by uncertain or noise, or characterized by complex relationships that standard approaches cannot properly face. The achievement of successful results for problems in biochemical and medical domains may require the integration of different type of data, together with computational task, model design, and learning methods. This survey summarizes typical aspects of the ML approach to problems and tasks, and treats the characteristics of data sets, models, tools, and evaluation techniques, in the context of their application in medical data analysis and bioinformatics, with emphasis on emergent approaches and research perspectives.

In the light of our medical staff's experience, the consequences of TIPS are not homogeneous for all the patients and a subgroup dies in the first 6 months after TIPS placement. Actually, there is no risk indicator to identify this subgroup of patients before treatment. An investigation for predicting the survival of cirrhotic patients treated with TIPS is carried out using a clinical database with 107 cases and 77 attributes. Four supervised machine learning classifiers are applied to discriminate between both subgroups of patients. The application of several feature subset selection (FSS) techniques has significantly improved the predictive accuracy of these classifiers and considerably reduced the amount of attributes in the classification models. Among FSS techniques, FSS-TREE, a new randomized algorithm inspired on the new EDA (estimation of distribution algorithm) paradigm has obtained the best average accuracy results for each classifier. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is a common complication and a leading cause of death in people with diabetes. However, the decline in kidney function varies considerably between patients and the determinants of diabetic nephropathy have not been clearly identified. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict the onset of diabetic nephropathy accurately with simple statistical approaches such as t-test or χ2-test. To accurately predict the onset of diabetic nephropathy, we applied various machine learning techniques to irregular and unbalanced diabetes dataset, such as support vector machine (SVM) classification and feature selection methods. Visualization of the risk factors was another important objective to give physicians intuitive information on each patient's clinical pattern. Methods and materials: We collected medical data from 292 patients with diabetes and performed preprocessing to extract 184 features from the irregular data. To predict the onset of diabetic nephropathy, we compared several classification methods such as logistic regression, SVM, and SVM with a cost sensitive learning method. We also applied several feature selection methods to remove redundant features and improve the classification performance. For risk factor analysis with SVM classifiers, we have developed a new visualization system which uses a nomogram approach. Results: Linear SVM classifiers combined with wrapper or embedded feature selection methods showed the best results. Among the 184 features, the classifiers selected the same 39 features and gave 0.969 of the area under the curve by receiver operating characteristics analysis. The visualization tool was able to present the effect of each feature on the decision via graphical output. Conclusions: Our proposed method can predict the onset of diabetic nephropathy about 2-3 months before the actual diagnosis with high prediction performance from an irregular and unbalanced dataset, which statistical methods such as t-test and logistic regression could not achieve. Additionally, the visualization system provides physicians with intuitive information for risk factor analysis. Therefore, physicians can benefit from the automatic early warning of each patient and visualize risk factors, which facilitate planning of effective and proper treatment strategies. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This capability is particularly well-suited to medical applications, especially those that depend on complex proteomic and genomic measurements. As a result, machine learning is frequently used in cancer diagnosis and detection. More recently machine learning has been applied to cancer prognosis and prediction. This latter approach is particularly interesting as it is part of a growing trend towards personalized, predictive medicine. In assembling this review we conducted a broad survey of the different types of machine learning methods being used, the types of data being integrated and the performance of these methods in cancer prediction and prognosis. A number of trends are noted, including a growing dependence on protein biomarkers and microarray data, a strong bias towards applications in prostate and breast cancer, and a heavy reliance on ""older"" technologies such artificial neural networks (ANNs) instead of more recently developed or more easily interpretable machine learning methods. A number of published studies also appear to lack an appropriate level of validation or testing. Among the better designed and validated studies it is clear that machine learning methods can be used to substantially (15-25%) improve the accuracy of predicting cancer susceptibility, recurrence and mortality. At a more fundamental level, it is also evident that machine learning is also helping to improve our basic understanding of cancer development and progression.","Cancer; Machine learning; Prediction; Prognosis; Risk","biological marker; artificial intelligence; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer growth; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; disease course; genomics; human; human computer interaction; learning; machine; medicine; microarray analysis; prediction; prognosis; prostate cancer; proteomics; review","D.S.
